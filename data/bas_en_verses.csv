Mu mbén ini nyen di nlama ke ni bisu i hiumul, ndik kiki di bi nok ibôdôl i bibôdle.","And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments.

I mut a ntéñbe ni biniigana bini, nyen a gwé Tata ni Man.",Everyone that pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. He that does remain in this teaching is the one that has both the Father and the Son.
63,1,10,"Ibale mut a nlo i bééni, ndi a lona bé bé i biniigana bini, ni leege bañ nye ikété mandap manan, to yéga ni yéga bañ nye.","If anyone comes to YOU and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into YOUR homes or say a greeting to him."

Also, not being content with these things, neither does he himself receive the brothers with respect, and those who are wanting to receive them he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation."
64,1,11,"A nugwéha, u nigle bañ mam mabe, ndi nigle mam malam. I mut a mboñ loñge a nlôl ni Nyambe, i mut a mboñ béba a bi tehe bé Nyambe.","Beloved one, be an imitator, not of what is bad, but of what is good. He that does good originates with God. He that does bad has not seen God."
64,1,12,"Lôk kéé yosôna i mbok mbôgi ilam inyu Démétriô, yak maliga momede ma mbok mbôgi ilam inyu yé. Ni maliga, yak bés di mbok mbôgi inyu yé, u nyi ki le mbôgi di mbok i yé maliga.","Demetrius has had witness borne to him by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we, also, are bearing witness, and you know that the witness we give is true."
64,1,13,"Me bak me gwé ngandak mam i tilna we, ndi me nsômbôl bé ke ni bisu i tilna we ni saô lôñni tinti.","I had many things to write you, yet I do not wish to go on writing you with ink and pen."
64,1,14,"Ndi me mbot ñem le m’a tehe we ndék ngéda, ni le d’a kwel i mbombom. Nsañ u ba ni we. Mawanda ma nyéga we.

65,1,5,"To hala kiki ni ntibil yaga yi i mam mana momasôna, me nyéñ hôñlaha bé le ngéda Yéhôva a bi mal tohol litén jé i loñ Égiptô, a bi yik tjé i bôt ba bi unda le ba gwé bé hémle.","I desire to remind YOU, despite YOUR knowing all things once for all time, that Jehovah, although he saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those not showing faith."

65,1,8,"Ndi to hala, Yak i bôt bana ba nhôiba ikété bieem, ba hindhak minsôn, ba yanak bôt ba gwé kunde i ngii yap, ba ôbhak ki môl ma bôt ba gwé lipém li Nyambe.","In like manner, notwithstanding, these men, too, indulging in dreams, are defiling the flesh and disregarding lordship and speaking abusively of glorious ones."

Ndi Yak ikété mam momasôna ba nok yaga, kiki binuga bi bi gwé bé yi, ba nke ni bisu i ôbôs bomede mu mam ma.","Yet these men are speaking abusively of all the things they really do not know; but all the things that they do understand naturally like the unreasoning animals, in these things they go on corrupting themselves."
65,1,11,"Hala a yé ngoo ngandak inyu yap, inyule ba bi noñ njel Kain, ba pala ki jôp i njel malôga i Balam inyu kôhna nsaa, ba bi tjiba ki ikété bibañga bi ngolba bi Kôra!","Too bad for them, because they have gone in the path of Cain, and have rushed into the erroneous course of Balaam for reward, and have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah!"

41,15,47,Ndi Maria Magdaléna lôñni Maria nyañ Yôsé ba kida ba mbéñge i homa mim u bé u niñne.,But Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses continued looking at where he had been laid.
41,15,5,"Ndi Yésu a bi timbhe ha bé nye to buk, kayéle hala a hélés Pilatô.","But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate began to marvel."
41,15,6,"Ndi hiki ngand Pasa, a bééna lem i pémés mut mok wada inyu limut, i mut limut li bé bat.","Well, from festival to festival he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they petitioned for."
41,15,7,"Ha ngéda i, mut wada ba bé sébél le Barabas, a bé i mok lôñni bakolba ngomin bape, ba ba bi nol mut mu ngolba yap.","At the time there was the so-called Barabbas in bonds with the seditionists, who in their sedition had committed murder."
41,15,8,"Jon limut li bôt li bi bet, li bôdôl soohe Pilatô inoñnaga ni jam a bé béna bôñôl bo.",So the crowd came on up and started to make petition according to what he used to do for them.
41,15,9,"A timbhe bo, a kal le: “Baa ni nsômbôl le me pémhene bé Kiñe Lôk Yuda?”","Pilate responded to them, saying: “Do YOU want me to release to YOU the king of the Jews?”"
41,16,1,"I ngéda kel Sabat i bi tagbe, Maria Magdaléna, Maria nyañ Yakôbô, ni Salômé ba somb binunumba le ba ke ba hoo gwo mim.","So when the sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices in order to come and grease him."
41,16,2,"Ndi kegla tutu, i hilo hi bisu hi sonde, kiki hiañgaa hi mpam ndigi, ba lo i soñ.","And very early on the first day of the week they came to the memorial tomb, when the sun had risen."

YOU are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was impaled. He was raised up, he is not here. See! The place where they laid him."

Ba bi añle bé mut jam jo ki jo inyule ba bé kon woñi.","So when they came out they fled from the memorial tomb, for trembling and strong emotion were gripping them. And they told nobody anything, for they were in fear. SHORT CONCLUSION Some late manuscripts and versions contain a short conclusion after Mark 16:8, as follows: But all the things that had been commanded they related briefly to those around Peter. Further, after these things, Jesus himself sent out through them from the east to the west the holy and incorruptible proclamation of everlasting salvation."
41,2,1,"Ndi i mbus ndék dilo, a témb a jôp i Kapernaum, nwin u ke le a yé i ndap.","However, after some days he again entered into Capernaum and he was reported to be at home."

I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”"
41,2,18,"Ndi banigil ba Yôhanes ni Farisai ba bééna lem i sôga je. Jon ba bi lo, ba bat nye le: “Inyuki banigil ba Yôhanes lôñni banigil ba Farisai ba gwé lem i sôga je, ndi banigil boñ ba gwé bé lem i sôga je?”","Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees practiced fasting. So they came and said to him: “Why is it the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees practice fasting, but your disciples do not practice fasting?”"
41,2,19,"Ha nyen Yésu a kal bo le: “I ngéda mbiimuda a yé lôñni bo, mawanda ma mbiimuda ma gwé bé njom yo ki yo i sôga je, hala bé? I ngéda mbiimuda a yé lôñni bo, ba nla bé sôga je.","And Jesus said to them: “While the bridegroom is with them the friends of the bridegroom cannot fast, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast."

41,2,22,"Nlélém jam ki, mut to wada a nha bé wai yondo ikété minlômbi mi dibôi di wai. Ibale a mboñ hala, wai y’a bol dibôi, i sôbi, yak dibôi di wai di ôbi.

But people put new wine into new wineskins.”"
41,2,23,"Ndi i kel Sabat, kiki a bé tagbe i nwom mi blé, banigil bé ba bôdôl ket mis ma blé mu kiki ba bé ke mu njel.","Now it happened that he was proceeding through the grainfields on the sabbath, and his disciples started to make their way plucking the heads of grain."
41,2,24,"Jon Farisai i kal nye le: “Nun-ki, inyuki banigil boñ ba yé i boñ jam li ta bé kunde i kel Sabat?”",So the Pharisees went saying to him: “Look here! Why are they doing on the sabbath what is not lawful?”

41,2,27,"I mbus, a kal bo le: “Nyambe a bi hek Sabat inyu mut binam, ndi a bi hek bé mut binam inyu Sabat.","So he went on to say to them: “The sabbath came into existence for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the sabbath;"

41,2,3,"Ba lona nye ñambge mut, bôt ba-na bon ba bé ba bééga nye.",And men came bringing him a paralytic carried by four.

41,4,26,"I mbus, a kal ki le: “Hala nyen Ane Nyambe i yé kiki ngéda mut a nwes mbôô ’isi.","So he went on to say: “In this way the kingdom of God is just as when a man casts the seed upon the ground,"
41,4,27,"A nañal juu, a telbak kegla, ndi a nyi bé lelaa mbôô i ño, to lelaa i nañ.","and he sleeps at night and rises up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows tall, just how he does not know."
41,4,28,"Hisi hiomede hi mboñ le mbôô i o ndék ni ndék: Hi nti ndugi man kai, i mbus ntudu u pam; sôk i nsôk, u yila nhôôlak ntudu nyonok ni mis.","Of its own self the ground bears fruit gradually, first the grass-blade, then the stalk head, finally the full grain in the head."
41,4,29,"Ndi ngéda matam ma nhôlôl ndigi, a ntégbaha nhôdôk kwade inyule ngéda libumbul i nkola.”","But as soon as the fruit permits it, he thrusts in the sickle, because the harvesttime has come.”"
41,4,3,"“Emblana. Nuna-ki, mut wada a bi pam i nwes mbôô.",“Listen. Look! The sower went out to sow.
41,4,30,A kônde ki kal le: “Di nla hégha Ane Nyambe ni kii? Tole di nla yoñ himbe hihéga inyu toñol yo?,"And he went on to say: “With what are we to liken the kingdom of God, or in what illustration shall we set it out?"
41,4,31,"I yé kiki hisiina hi mbôô, ngéda ba bi bel hio, hi bé loo mbôô yosôna bititigi hana ’isi.","Like a mustard grain, which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds that are on the earth—"
41,4,32,"Ndi ngéda ba mal bel yo, i nañ, i loo mbônji yosôna bikeñi, i ti mintjep minkeñi kayéle dinuni di ngii di nla léba liyééne isi yiye yé.”","but when it has been sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all other vegetables and produces great branches, so that the birds of the heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow.”"
41,4,33,"Ni i nya ngandak dihéga i nyen a bé añle bo bañga i Nyambe, inoñnaga ni kiki ba bé la nok yo.","So with many illustrations of that sort he would speak the word to them, as far as they were able to listen."
41,4,34,"Ni maliga, a bé pôdôs bé bo ibabé i yoñ hihéga, ndi a bé toñle banigil bé mam momasôna ngéda ba bé botama.","Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, but privately to his disciples he would explain all things."
41,4,35,"I nlélém kel, ngéda kôkôa i bi kwo, a kal bo le: “Loga, di yap uu ngwañ tuye.”","And on that day, when evening had fallen, he said to them: “Let us cross to the other shore.”"
41,4,36,"Kiki ba mal huuha limut, ba yoñ nye ikété môñgô hala kiki a bé, yak môñgô mimpe mi noñ nye.","So, after they had dismissed the crowd, they took him in the boat, just as he was, and there were other boats with him."
41,4,37,"Ndi soso mbuk mbebi a bôdôl hôñ ni ngui, yak mangudga ma kahal kôba ikété môñgô kayéle môñgô u bé bebee ni yon ni malép.","Now a great violent windstorm broke out, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was close to being swamped."
41,4,38,"Ndi a bé nyoo mbus môñgô, a kenek ’ilo i ngii mbôñga. Jon ba tôdôl nye, ba kal nye le: “A Lét, hala a nkal bé we to jam le di yé bebee ni wo?”","But he was in the stern, sleeping upon a pillow. So they woke him up and said to him: “Teacher, do you not care that we are about to perish?”"
41,4,39,"Ha nyen a telep, a bam mbuk mbebi, a kal ki tuye le: “Hogbe! Mom nwee!” Ha nyen mbuk mbebi a mal, homa nyensôna a mom yaga nwee.","With that he roused himself and rebuked the wind and said to the sea: “Hush! Be quiet!” And the wind abated, and a great calm set in."
41,4,4,"Mu kiki a bé nwes mbôô, ihogi i kwo i nloñ, ndi dinuni di lo di je yosôna.","And as he was sowing, some seed fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate it up."
41,4,40,Ndi a kal bo le: “Inyuki ni nkon woñi hala? Baa ni yé ngi bana hémle?”,So he said to them: “Why are YOU fainthearted? Do YOU not yet have any faith?”
41,4,41,"Ndi ba bé kon woñi iloo hihéga, ba kalnaga bo ni bo le: “Njee mut yaga nunu? Ngo yak mbebi ni tuye bi nôgôl nye.”","But they felt an unusual fear, and they would say to one another: “Who really is this, because even the wind and the sea obey him?”"
41,4,5,"Ipe i kwo i bahoma ba ngok i het biték bi bé bé ngandak, i pala ki o inyule biték bi bé bé ndip.","And other seed fell upon the rocky place where it, of course, did not have much soil, and it immediately sprang up because of not having depth of soil."
41,4,6,"Ndi ngéda hiañgaa hi bi pam, hi ligis yo inyule i bééna bé minkañ.","But when the sun rose, it was scorched, and for not having root it withered."
41,4,7,"Ipe ki i kwo ipôla biloo, ndi biloo bi o, bi hô yo, i num bé matam.","And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
41,4,8,"Ndi ipe i bi kwo i hisi hilam, i nañ, i bôl, i bôdôl num matam môm maa, môm masamal, ni mbôgôl ngélé.”","But others fell upon the fine soil, and, coming up and increasing, they began to yield fruit, and they were bearing thirtyfold, and sixty and a hundred.”"
41,4,9,"I mbus, a kônde le: “Nu a gwé maôô i emble, a emble.”",So he added the word: “Let him that has ears to listen listen.”
41,5,1,"I mbus, ba pam nyoo uu ngwañ u tuye, i nkoñ u bôt ba Gérasa.","Well, they got to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gerasenes."
41,5,10,Ha nyen i mut nu a kônde soohe Yésu le a pémés bañ mimbuu mimbe le mi nyodi mu loñ i.,And he entreated him many times not to send the spirits out of the country.
41,5,11,Ndi liuñ li ngôi likeñi li bé jél ha i hikôa.,Now a great herd of swine was there at the mountain feeding.
41,5,12,"Ha nyen mimbuu mimbe mi soohe nye le: “Ep bés mu ngôi, le di jôp ikété yap.”","So they entreated him, saying: “Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.”"
41,5,13,"A ti nwo kunde i. Ha nyen mimbuu mimbe mi pam, mi jôp ikété ngôi; ndi liuñ li ngôi li ke ngwéé, li kwo i nsôsôgô, li beha i tuye. Ngôi i bé jam kiki bo dikôô diba, i yin ikété tuye.","And he permitted them. With that the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed over the precipice into the sea, about two thousand of them, and they drowned one after another in the sea."
41,5,14,"Ndi batééda ngôi ba ke ngwéé, ba añal jam li i tison ni mu nkoñ u wonsôna. Ha nyen bôt ba lo i béñge kii i bi tagbe.",But the herders of them fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside; and people came to see what it was that had happened.
41,5,15,"Jon bôt ba lo yak Yésu, ba tehe le i mut a bééna ntôñ u mimbuu mimbe a yii, a hééba mbot, yak yi i nlo nye, ba kon woñi.","So they came to Jesus, and they beheld the demon-possessed man sitting clothed and in his sound mind, this man that had had the legion; and they grew fearful."
41,5,16,"Yak i bôt ba bi tehe i jam li, ba añle bo lelaa mam ma bi tagbe inyu mut a bééna mimbuu mimbe ni inyu ngôi.","Also, those who had seen it related to them how this had happened to the demon-possessed man and about the swine."
41,5,17,Ha nyen ba bôdôl soohe Yésu le a nyodi i nkoñ wap.,And so they started to entreat him to go away from their districts.
41,5,18,"I ngéda Yésu a bé jôp i môñgô, i mut a bééna mimbuu mimbe a soohe le a noñ nye.","Now as he was boarding the boat, the man that had been demon-possessed began entreating him that he might continue with him."
41,5,19,"Ndi Yésu a neebe bé, a kal nye le: “Témb i mbai yoñ ni i lihaa joñ, añle bo mam momasôna Yéhôva a mboñ inyu yoñ lôñni konangoo a ñunda we.”","However, he did not let him, but said to him: “Go home to your relatives, and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he had on you.”"
41,5,2,"Ndi kiki Yésu a nyodi ndik ikété môñgô, mut wada nu a bééna mbuu mbe a lo i boma nye, a pémlak i kotoo soñ.",And immediately after he got out of the boat a man under the power of an unclean spirit met him from among the memorial tombs.
41,5,20,"I mut nu a ke, a bôdôl añal i Dékapôli mam momasôna Yésu a bi boñ inyu yé; hala a hélés bôt bobasôna.","And he went away and started to proclaim in the Decapolis all the things Jesus did for him, and all the people began to wonder."
41,5,21,"Kiki Yésu a ntémb a yap uu ngwañ lôñni môñgô, limut li bôt likeñi li kodba ipañ yé ngéda a bé a ngi yii bebee ni tuye.",After Jesus had crossed back again in the boat to the opposite shore a great crowd gathered together to him; and he was beside the sea.
41,5,22,"Ñane ndap bibégés wada, nu jôl jé le Yairô, a lo; kiki a ntehe Yésu, a kwo i makôô mé.","Now one of the presiding officers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came and, on catching sight of him, he fell at his feet"

Would you please come and put your hands upon her that she may get well and live.”"
41,5,24,"Ha nyen Yésu a ke lôñni nye, yak limut li bôt likeñi li bé noñ nye li kahal hihe nye.",At that he went off with him. And a great crowd was following him and pressing against him.
41,5,25,"Ndi muda wada a bé ha, nu matjél ma bi bôdôl pam hala a bé jôm li nwii ni ima.","Now there was a woman subject to a flow of blood twelve years,"

41,5,27,"I ngéda a bi nok miñañ inyu Yésu, a lo nye i mbus ikété limut, a tihba mbot yé ngii,","When she heard the things about Jesus, she came behind in the crowd and touched his outer garment;"
41,5,28,"inyule a bé waa bé kalba le: “Ibale me ntihba to mambot mé ma ngii, m’a mbôôp.”",for she kept saying: “If I touch just his outer garments I shall get well.”
41,5,29,"I nlélém ngéda, matjél mé ma kidi, a nôgda munu nyuu yé le béba yé kon i mal.","And immediately her fountain of blood dried up, and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness."
41,5,3,"Liyééne jé li bé i kotoo soñ; ipam ha ngéda i, mut nye ki nye a bi la bé kañ nye, to ni nsañ bikei.","He had his haunt among the tombs; and up to that time absolutely nobody was able to bind him fast even with a chain,"

41,5,31,"Ndi banigil bé ba kal nye le: “U ntehe limut li nhihe we, ndi u badak le: ‘Njee a ntihba me?’”","But his disciples began to say to him: “You see the crowd pressing in upon you, and do you say, ‘Who touched me?’”"
41,5,32,Ndi a bé béñge homa nyensôna inyu tehe njee a mboñ hala.,"However, he was looking around to see her that had done this."
41,5,33,"Ndi muda a lo, a kwo i bisu gwé, a konok woñi, a sehlaga, a yik jam li mpémél nye, a kal nye maliga momasôna.","But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth."
41,5,34,"Yésu a kal nye le: “A ngond yem, hémle yoñ i mélés kon woñ. Kenek ni nsañ, i béba kon ini i tééñga ha bañ ki we.”","He said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be in good health from your grievous sickness.”"

41,5,36,"Ndi Yésu a nok nkwel wap, a kal ñane ndap bibégés le: “U kon bañ woñi, unda ndik le u gwé hémle.”","But Jesus, overhearing the word being spoken, said to the presiding officer of the synagogue: “Have no fear, only exercise faith.”"
41,5,37,"Ndi a bi nwas bé le mut nye ki nye a noñ nye handugi Pétrô, Yakôbô, lôñni manyañ Yakôbô le Yôhanes.",Now he did not let anyone follow along with him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
41,5,38,"Ha nyen ba bi ke i ndap ñane ndap bibégés, a koba ngandak liyôgbe, ni bôt ba bé ee, ba londok makeñi.","So they came to the house of the presiding officer of the synagogue, and he beheld the noisy confusion and those weeping and letting out many wails,"
41,5,39,"Kiki a njôp, a kal bo le: “Inyuki ni ñee, ni boñok liyôgbe lini? Mañge a nwo bé, a yé i ke ’ilo.”","and, after stepping in, he said to them: “Why are YOU causing noisy confusion and weeping? The young child has not died, but is sleeping.”"
41,5,4,"Ba bééna lem i kañ nye minsañ i moo ni i makôô, ndi to hala a bé a pat minsañ, a bôk bikei; mut to wada a bééna bé ngui i yémbél nye.","because he had oftentimes been bound with fetters and chains, but the chains were snapped apart by him and the fetters were actually smashed; and nobody had the strength to subdue him."

But, having put them all out, he took along the young child’s father and mother and those with him, and he went in where the young child was."
41,5,41,"Ha nyen a gwel woo u mañge, a kal nye le: “Talita kumi,” hala a nkobla le: “A hingongonda, me nkal we le: ‘Telep!’”","And, taking the hand of the young child, he said to her: “Talitha cumi,” which, translated, means: “Maiden, I say to you, Get up!”"
41,5,42,"I nlélém ngéda, hingonda hi telep, hi bôdôl ke. (A bééna jôm li nwii ni ima.) Ha nyen ba yôm, ba kon maséé iloo hihéga.","And immediately the maiden rose and began walking, for she was twelve years old. And at once they were beside themselves with great ecstasy."
41,5,43,"Ndi a ti bo oda, a tiimbaga le mut a yi bañ jam li, a kal ki le ba ti nye yom i je.","But he ordered them again and again to let no one learn of this, and he said that something should be given her to eat."

I put you under oath by God not to torment me.”"
41,5,8,"Inyule Yésu a bé kal wo le: “Nyodi ikété mut nunu, a mbuu mbe unu.”","For he had been telling it: “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.”"

41,6,10,"A kônde ki kal bo le: “To imbe ndap ni njôp, yéna ha letee ni nyodi ha homa nu.","Further, he said to them: “Wherever YOU enter into a home, stay there until YOU go out of that place."

41,6,12,"Ha nyen ba ke, ba kahal téé likalô le bôt ba nlama hiel miñem,",So they set out and preached in order that people might repent;

41,6,18,Inyule Yôhanes a bé kal Hérôdé le: “I ta bé we kunde i bana nwaa maasoñ.”,For John had repeatedly said to Herod: “It is not lawful for you to be having the wife of your brother.”
41,6,19,"Jon Hérôdia a bé téédana nye hiun, a yéñék ki nol nye, ndi a bé la bé.","But Herodias was nursing a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, but could not."

42,8,7,"lpe ki i kwo ipôla biloo, ndi biloo bi o lôñni yo, bi hô yo.","Some other fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with it choked it off."

42,8,9,Ndi banigil bé ba bat nye kii hihéga hini hi nkobla.,But his disciples began to ask him what this illustration might mean.
42,9,1,"I mbus, a sébél jôm ni iba, a ti bo ngui ni kunde i pémés mimbuu mimbe nwominsôna ni i mélés makon.",Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure sicknesses.
42,9,10,"I ngéda baôma ba bi témb, ba añle Yésu mam momasôna ba bi boñ. Ha nyen a bi yoñ bo, a kena botama ipañ, i tison yada ba nsébél le Bétsaida.",And when the apostles returned they recounted to him what things they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew to privacy into a city called Bethsaida.
42,9,11,"Ndi kiki mamut ma nyi hala, ma noñ nye. A leege bo loñge, a bôdôl ki añle bo mam inyu Ane Nyambe, a tibil yak bôt ba bé kon.","But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure."
42,9,12,"I mbus, i ngéda u u bé bebee ni sude, jôm ni iba ba lo, ba kal nye le: “Huuha limut, inyu boñ le li ke i minkoñ ni mambai ma ma yé bebee inyu kôhna linañle ni bijek, inyule di yé hana i ñoñ.”","Then the day started to decline. The twelve now came up and said to him: “Dismiss the crowd, that they may go into the villages and countryside round about and procure lodging and find provisions, because out here we are in a lonely place.”"
42,9,13,"Ndi a kal bo le: “Tina bo bijek bébomede.” Ba kal le: “Di gwé bé yom ipe, ndik bret bitan ni tjobi diba, handugi le bésbomede di ke, di somb bijek inyu bôt bana bobasôna.”","But he said to them: “YOU give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fishes, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy foodstuffs for all these people.”"
42,9,14,"Jam kiki bo dikôô ditan di bôlôm tjon di bé ha. Ndi a kal banigil bé le: “Boña bo le ba yén mintôñ mintôñ, hiki ntôñ môm matan ma bôt.”","They were, in fact, about five thousand men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them recline as at meals, in groups of about fifty each.”"
42,9,15,"Ba boñ ki hala, bôt bobasôna ba yén ’isi.",And they did so and had them all recline.
42,9,16,"Ha nyen a bi yoñ bret bitan ni tjobi diba, a pa mis i ngii, a sayap gwo. I mbus, a bek gwo, a bôdôl ti gwo banigil le ba lôôs gwo limut.","Then taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, blessed them and broke them up and began to give them to the disciples to set before the crowd."
42,9,17,"Hala nyen bôt bobasôna ba bi je, ba nuu, ba yoñ yak bikét bi bi yégle, bi ti jôm li bisel ni biba.","So they all ate and were satisfied, and the surplus that they had was taken up, twelve baskets of fragments."
42,9,18,"I mbus, ngéda a bé soohe nyetama, banigil bé ba lo nye ipañ, a bat bo le: “Mamut ma nkal le me yé njee?”","Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came together to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”"
42,9,19,"Ba timbhe, ba kal le: “Yôhanes Nsôble, ndi bape ba nkal le Éliya, bape ki ba nkal le wada ikété bapôdôl ba kôba nyen a ntuge.”","In reply they said: “John the Baptist; but others, Elijah, and still others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”"
42,9,2,"A ep bo i añal ñañ nlam u Ane Nyambe ni i mélés makon,","And so he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God and to heal,"
42,9,20,Ha nyen a kal bo le: “Ndi bé ni nkal le me yé njee?” Pétrô a timbhe le: “Kristô nu Nyambe.”,"Then he said to them: “YOU, though, who do YOU say I am?” Peter said in reply: “The Christ of God.”"
42,9,21,"I mbus, a tibil yaga béhe bo, a kal bo le ba kalak bañ to mut hala,","Then in a stern talk to them he instructed them not to be telling this to anybody,"
42,9,22,"ndi a kal le: “Man mut a nlama nok ngandak ndutu, mimañ mi litén ni baéga biprisi ni bayimbén b’a tjél nye, ba nol ki nye, ndi a’ tuglana i hilo hi nyônôs aa.”","but said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”"
42,9,23,"I mbus, a kal bôt bobasôna le: “Ibale mut a nsômbôl noñ me, a nlama ha bé niñ inyu yé nyemede, ndi a begee kék yé njiiha hiki kel, a noñ me ibabé waa.","Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually."
42,9,24,"Inyule nu ni nu a nsômbôl tohol niñ yé, a’ nimis yo; ndi nu ni nu a nimis niñ yé inyu yem, nyen a’ tohol yo.",For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake is the one that will save it.
42,9,25,"Ni maliga, umbe nseñ mut a’ bana ibale a nkôhna nkoñ ’isi wonsôna ndi nyemede a nimil tole a nimis niñ yé?","Really, what does a man benefit himself if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers damage?"
42,9,26,"Inyule nu ni nu a nwél me ni bibañga gwem nyuu, yak Man mut a’ wél i mut nu nyuu ngéda a’ lo ikété lipém jé, ni li Isañ, ni li biañgel bipubi.","For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of this one when he arrives in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels."
42,9,27,"Ndi me nkal bé maliga le, bahogi ipôla bôt ba téé hana b’a wo yaga bé ibale ba mbôk bé ba tehe Ane Nyambe.”","But I tell YOU truthfully, There are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the kingdom of God.”"
42,9,28,"Hala nyen jam kiki bo dilo juem i mbus le a bi pot bibañga bini, a yoñ Pétrô, Yôhanes lôñni Yakôbô, a bedna bo i hikôa inyu soohe.","In actual fact, about eight days after these words, he took Peter and John and James along and climbed up into the mountain to pray."
42,9,29,"Kiki a bé soohe, su wé u héñha, yak mambot mé ma pôp le peññ, ma bayak.",And as he was praying the appearance of his face became different and his apparel became glitteringly white.
42,9,3,"a kal ki bo le: “Ni yoñ bañ yom yo ki yo inyu liké, to ntoñgo, to bot bijek, to bret, to moni; ni yoñ bañ to mambot ima.","and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch, nor bread nor silver money; neither have two undergarments."
42,9,30,"Ndi nun-ki, bôt iba ba bé kwel ni nye: Môsi bo Éliya.","Also, look! two men were conversing with him, who were Moses and Elijah."
42,9,31,"Ba bi nene ni lipém, ba bôdôl pot inyu liké jé, li a bé bebee ni yônôs i Yérusalem.",These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure that he was destined to fulfill at Jerusalem.

42,9,34,"Ndi ngéda a bé pot i mam mana, ond i pam, i bôdôl hô bo. Kiki ond i nhô bo, ba kon woñi.","But as he was saying these things a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became fearful."

42,9,37,"I kel i bé noñ ha, i ngéda ba bi sôs hikôa, limut li bôt likeñi li boma nye.","On the succeeding day, when they got down from the mountain, a great crowd met him."

42,9,4,"To imbe ndap ni njôp, yéna ha, ni nyodne ki ha.","But wherever YOU enter into a home, stay there and leave from there."
42,9,40,"Me bak me soohe banigil boñ le ba pémés wo, ndi ba nla bé.”","And I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”"

However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and delivered him to his father."
42,9,43,"Bôt bobasôna ba bé nhelek inyu ngui keñi i Nyambe. Kiki ba bé nhelek inyu mam momasôna a bé boñ, a kal banigil bé le:","Well, they all began to be astounded at the majestic power of God. Now as they were all marveling at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples:"

42,9,46,"I mbus, nkaa u bôô ipôla yap inyu yi njee a yé nunkeñi.",Then a reasoning entered among them as to who would be the greatest of them.

Peter also was standing with them and warming himself."
43,18,19,Ha nyen ñéga biprisi a bi bat Yésu mambadga inyu banigil bé ni inyu biniigana gwé.,And so the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.

43,18,24,"I mbus, Ana a ep nye yak prisi keñi le Kaifa; Yésu a bé a ngi yii nkañak.",Then Annas sent him away bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

But they themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace, that they might not get defiled but might eat the passover."
43,18,29,"Ha nyen Pilatô a bi pam i mbégdé, a boma bo, a kal le: “Umbe nsohi ni ñôm mut nunu?”",Therefore Pilate came outside to them and said: “What accusation do YOU bring against this man?”
43,18,3,"Jon Yuda a bi lona ntôñ bisônda ni batat ba ba bé lôl yak baéga biprisi lôñni Farisai; ba lo ha ni nwai lôñni bilambe, yak ni bijôl bi gwét.",Therefore Judas took the soldier band and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons.

43,18,33,"Jon Pilatô a bi témb a jôp i ndap ngomin keñi, a sébél Yésu, a bat nye le: “Baa u yé Kiñe Lôk Yuda?”",So Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”
43,18,34,"Yésu a timbhe le: “Baa u mbat hala inyule wemede u ngwés toi yi, tole inyule u nok bôt bape ba mpot hala inyu yem?”","Jesus answered: “Is it of your own originality that you say this, or did others tell you about me?”"

43,19,10,"Ha nyen Pilatô a bi kal nye le: “Baa u ntjél timbhe me? Baa u nyi bé le me gwé kunde i nwas we, me gwé ki kunde i nol we?”",Hence Pilate said to him: “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know I have authority to release you and I have authority to impale you?”
43,19,11,"Yésu a timbhe nye le: “U bak bé le u bana kunde yo ki yo i ngii yem, handugi le i lôl we i ngii. Jon i mut a nti we me a gwé béba i nlôôha keñi.”",Jesus answered him: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man that handed me over to you has greater sin.”
43,19,12,"Inyu hala nyen Pilatô a bi waa bé yéñ njel i nwas nye, ndi Lôk Yuda i bé lond le: “Ibale u nwas i mut nunu, u ta bé liwanda li Kaisa.

43,19,16,"I mbus, a ti bo nye le ba péni nye i kék. Ha nyen ba bi kena Yésu.","At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled. Then they took charge of Jesus."

43,19,19,"Pilatô a bi tila ki i libam, a ha libam li i kék njiiha. I bé ntilga mu le: “Yésu mut Nasaret, Kiñe Lôk Yuda.”",Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the torture stake. It was written: “Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.”
43,19,2,"Bisônda bi bañ ntut biloo, bi ha wo i ño wé, bi ha ki nye mbôñgô mbot wedewede,",And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him with a purple outer garment;

But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from the top throughout its length."
43,19,24,"Jon bi bi kalna le: “Di was bañ yo, ndi di leñ mbam inyu yi njee a’ yoñ yo.” Hala a bé inyu yônôs tilna i i nkal le: “Ba bi kabna mbot yem ipôla yap, ba leñ ki mbam inyu mbot yem.” Bisônda bi bi boñ toi i mam mana.","Therefore they said to one another: “Let us not tear it, but let us determine by lots over it whose it will be.” This was that the scripture might be fulfilled: “They apportioned my outer garments among themselves, and upon my apparel they cast lots.” And so the soldiers really did these things."
43,19,25,"Ndi nyañ Yésu a bé a téé ha bebee ni kék njiiha, yak manyañ nyañ nu muda; lôñni Maria nwaa Klôpa, ni Maria Magdaléna.","By the torture stake of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and the sister of his mother; Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."

Therefore he came and took his body away."
43,19,39,"Nikôdémô, i mut a bi bôk a lo yak Yésu juu, yak nye a bi lona nunumba i mire mpôdnaga ni alôé, i édék jam kiki bo môm maa ma kilô.","Nicodemus also, the man that came to him in the night the first time, came bringing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds of it."

43,4,43,"I mbus dilo diba dini, a nyodi nyoo, a ke i Galiléa.",After the two days he left there for Galilee.
43,4,44,Ndi Yésu nyemede a bi bok mbôgi le mpôdôl a gwé bé lipém i loñ yé nyemede.,"Jesus himself, however, bore witness that in his own homeland a prophet has no honor."
43,4,45,"I ngéda a bi pam i Galiléa, bôt ba Galiléa ba leege nye, inyule ba bi tehe mam momasôna a bi boñ i ngand i Yérusalem, inyule yak bo ba bi ke i ngand.","When, therefore, he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they also had gone to the festival."
43,4,46,"I mbus, a témb i Kana nu Galiléa, i het a bi yilha malép wai. Ndi ngwélél wada nu kiñe a bééna lok yé i i bé kon i Kapernaum.","Accordingly he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a certain attendant of the king whose son was sick in Capernaum."
43,4,47,"I ngéda i mut nu a bi nok le Yésu a nyodi i Yudéa, a lo i Galiléa, a ke i boma nye, a bat nye le a sôs i mélés kon u lok yé inyule i bé bebee ni nyemb.","When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went off to him and began asking him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying."
43,4,48,"Ndi Yésu a kal nye le: “Ibale ni ntehe bé biyimbne ni manyaga, ni yé mbén i hémle.”","However, Jesus said to him: “Unless YOU people see signs and wonders, YOU will by no means believe.”"
43,4,49,"Ngwélél nu kiñe a kal nye le: “A Nwet, sôs ilole man wem a nwo.”","The attendant of the king said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”"

43,4,52,Ha nyen a bi bat bo imbe ngeñ a bi témbna mbôô wé. Ba timbhe nye le: “Lihep jé li bi mal yani i ngeñ yada i mbus kosi.”,Therefore he began to inquire of them the hour in which he got better in health. Accordingly they said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
43,4,53,"Ha nyen isañ a bi yi le ha yaga ngeñ i nyen Yésu a bi kal nye le: “Man woñ a yé i niñ.” Jon a bi hémle, nye ni ndap yé lihaa yosôna.",Therefore the father knew it was in the very hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son lives.” And he and his whole household believed.
43,4,54,"Hala a bé yimbne i nyônôs iba le Yésu a bi boñ ngéda a bi nyodi i Yudéa, a lo i Galiléa.",Again this was the second sign Jesus performed when he came out of Judea into Galilee.

43,4,8,(Inyule banigil bé ba bi ke i tison inyu somb bijek.),(For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy foodstuffs.)

43,5,11,"Ndi a timbhe bo le: “I nlélém mut u mélés kon wem, won u nkal me le: ‘Bada nañi yoñ, kenek.’”","But he answered them: “The very one that made me sound in health said to me, ‘Pick up your cot and walk.’”"
43,5,12,"Ba kal nye le: “Njee a nkal we le: ‘Bada nañi, kenek’?”","They asked him: “Who is the man that told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”"
43,5,13,"Ndi i mut a bi mbôôp a bi yi bé njee nu, inyule Yésu a bi sooma ikété limut li bé ha.","But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had turned aside, there being a crowd in the place."

U boñ ha bañ béba, tiga le jam libe iloo lini li pémél we.”","After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you have become sound in health.

43,5,15,"I mut nu a ke, a añle Lôk Yuda le Yésu nyen a bi mélés kon wé.",The man went away and told the Jews it was Jesus that made him sound in health.
43,5,16,"Inyu hala nyen Lôk Yuda i bé tééñga Yésu, inyule a bé boñ mam mana i kel Sabat.","So on this account the Jews went persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during Sabbath."
43,5,17,"Ndi a timbhe bo le: “Letee ni nano, Tata a ma waa bé sal, to me me nwaa bé sal.”","But he answered them: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.”"
43,5,18,"Jon Lôk Yuda i bé nnayak le i nol ndik nye, inyule i bé kal le a mbôk mbén Sabat, a nsébél yak Nyambe le Isañ, a ébga le bo Nyambe ba kôli.","On this account, indeed, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God."
43,5,19,"Jon Yésu a bi timbhe, a kal bo le: “Me nkal yaga bé maliga le, Man a nla bé boñ jam jo ki jo ni nyemede, ndik i jam a ntehe Isañ a mboñ.

For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner."
43,5,2,"Ndi titimba yada i bé i Yérusalem, ba bé sébél yo ni hop Lôk Héber le Bétsata, i bé bebee ni nwemel u Mintômba, i ban-ga mabebe matan ma ma gwé mél.","Now in Jerusalem at the sheepgate there is a pool designated in Hebrew Bethzatha, with five colonnades."

43,5,21,"Inyule nlélém kiki Isañ a ntugul bawoga, a tinak bo niñ, hala ki nyen yak Man a nti tonjee a ngwés niñ.","For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to."
43,5,22,"Inyule Tata a nkéés bé mut to wada, ndi a mbii bikééhene gwobisôna i moo ma Man,","For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son,"

43,5,26,"Inyule nlélém kiki Tata a gwé ngui i ti niñ, hala nyen a bi ti yak Man ngui i ti niñ.","For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself."

43,5,37,"Yak Tata nyemede nu a bi ep me a bi bok mbôgi inyu yem. Kekikel, ni ma bé nok kiñ yé, to tehe su wé,","Also, the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. YOU have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure;"

43,8,23,"Yésu a timbhe bo le: “Me nkal yaga bé maliga le, hiki mut a mboñ béba, a yé nkol u béba.","Therefore the Jews began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going YOU cannot come.’”"
43,8,24,"Jam lipe ki, nkol u nla bé yégle i ndap nwet wé i boga ni boga; ndi man nwet ndap a nyégle mu i boga ni boga.",So he went on to say to them: “YOU are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. YOU are from this world; I am not from this world.
43,8,25,"Jon ibale Man a nkobol bé, wee ni maliga, ni ta ha bé minkol.","Therefore I said to YOU, YOU will die in YOUR sins. For if YOU do not believe that I am he, YOU will die in YOUR sins.”"
43,8,26,"Me nyi le ni yé mbôda Abraham, ndi ni nyéñ njel i nol me inyule ni neebe bé bibañga gwem.",Therefore they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “Why am I even speaking to YOU at all?

43,8,46,"Ha nyen Lôk Yuda i bi kal nye le: “U yé ngi pamna môm matan ma nwii, ndi u nkal le u bi tehe Abraham?”","Because I, on the other hand, tell the truth, YOU do not believe me."

43,9,26,Ha nyen ba bi kal nye le: “Kii a mboñ we? Lelaa a nyibil we mis?”,Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”

44,12,18,"I ngéda kel i bi ye, liyôgbe li bé ngandak ipôla bisônda, bi badbaga toi kii i mpémél Pétrô.","Well, when it became day, there was no little stir among the soldiers over what really had become of Peter."

So with one accord they came to him and, after persuading Blastus, who was in charge of the bedchamber of the king, they began suing for peace, because their country was supplied with food from that of the king."
44,12,21,"I kel litén li bi kodba, Hérôdé a haba mbot kiñe, a yén i yééne bakéés, a bôdôl ti bo nkwel i mbamba.",But on a set day Herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down upon the judgment seat and began giving them a public address.

44,13,12,"Kiki ngomin pes mbok a ntehe i jam li ntagbe, a yila nhémle inyule biniigana bi Yéhôva bi bi hélés nye.","Then the proconsul, upon seeing what had happened, became a believer, as he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah."

45,10,17,Jon hémle i nlôl i mam mut a nok. Yak mam ma nôga ndigi ngéda mut a mpot bañga inyu Kristô.,So faith follows the thing heard. In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ.

45,10,3,"Inyule kiki ba nyi bé telepsép i Nyambe, ndi ba yéñék ndik téé yap bomede, ba bi suhus bé bomede isi telepsép i Nyambe.","for, because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"Inyule Kristô a yé lisuk li mbén Môsi, inyu boñ le hiki mut a ñunda le a gwé hémle a ba mut a téé sép.","For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness."
45,10,5,Inyule Môsi a ntila inyu telepsép i nlôl ni njel Mbén le: “I mut a mboñ i mam mana a’ niñ ni njel yap.”,For Moses writes that the man that has done the righteousness of the Law will live by it.
45,10,6,"Ndi Bitilna bipubi bi ñunda ki le ni njel hémle nyen mut a nla éña le a téé sép; bi nkal le: “U kalak bañ ikété ñem woñ le: ‘Njee a ga bet nyoo i ngii?’ Hala wee inyu sôhna Kristô hana ’isi,","But the righteousness resulting from faith speaks in this manner: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ that is, to bring Christ down;"
45,10,7,tole: ‘Njee a ga sôs i soñkum?’ Hala wee inyu boñ le a héya Kristô ikété bawoga.”,"or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.”"

45,10,9,"Inyule ibale u mpahal i mbamba ni nyo woñ le Yésu a yé Nwet, u undga ki le u nhémle ikété ñem woñ le Nyambe a bi tugul nye ikété bawoga, ki w’a kôhna tohi.","For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your own mouth,’ that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved."
45,11,1,"Jon me mbat le: Baa Nyambe a bi tjôô litén jé? To jam! Inyule yak me me yé man Lôk Israel, mbôda Abraham, me nlôl i litén li Benyamin.","I ask, then, God did not reject his people, did he? Never may that happen! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,10,"Mis map ma kôp jiibe kayéle ma tehna ha bañ, yak mbus yap i hôdôp ngéda yosôna.”","let their eyes become darkened so as not to see, and always bow down their back.”"

But by their false step there is salvation to people of the nations, to incite them to jealousy."
45,11,12,"Nano, ibale baage yap i nlona nkoñ ’isi lingwañ, yak libak le nsoñgi wap u nsôs li lon-ga bôt ba matén lingwañ, bôô ni ngélé yañen lingwañ l’a ba ngéda nsoñgi wap u ga yon?","Now if their false step means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, how much more will the full number of them mean it!"
45,11,13,"Nano me mpôdôs bé ba ni yé bôt ba biloñ bipe. Kiki me yé ñôma nu biloñ bipe, me nti nson wem lipém","Now I speak to YOU who are people of the nations. Forasmuch as I am, in reality, an apostle to the nations, I glorify my ministry,"

45,11,16,"Jam lipe ki, ibale i ndék flawa i i nyôña kiki sesema i matam ma bisu i yé pubhaga, wee flawa yosôna i yé pubhaga; ibale nkañ u yé mpubhaga, wee yak mintjep mi yé mimpubhaga.","Further, if the part taken as firstfruits is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are also."
45,11,17,"Ndi ibale Nyambe a bi kit mintjep minhogi mi e ôlivé, ndi a boge we mu e i, to hala kiki u yé ntjep u e ôlivé bikai, kayéle yak we u kôhna mam malam mu nkañ wé,","However, if some of the branches were broken off but you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the olive’s root of fatness,"
45,11,18,"u ngôgbene bañ mintjep ba nkit. Ndi ibale u ngôgbene nwo, u hôya bañ le we bé nyen u bééga nkañ, ndi nkañ won u bééga we.","do not be exulting over the branches. If, though, you are exulting over them, it is not you that bear the root, but the root bears you."
45,11,19,W’a kal ni me le: “Ba bi kit mintjep inyu boñ le men ba boge mu.”,"You will say, then: “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.”"
45,11,2,"Nyambe a bi tjôô bé litén jé, li a bi bôk ndugi a pohol. Baa ni nyi bé i jam tilna i nkal inyu Éliya, kiki a bi soohe Nyambe ikolba Israel?","God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. Why, do YOU not know what the Scripture says in connection with Elijah, as he pleads with God against Israel?"
45,11,20,"Maliga ma! Inyu ngitophémle yap nyen ba bi kit nwo, ndi we u téé ni njel hémle yoñ. U ngôgôp bañ, ndi kon woñi.","All right! For their lack of faith they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Quit having lofty ideas, but be in fear."
45,11,21,"Inyule ibale Nyambe a bi bañal bé bañga mintjep mi e ôlivé, wee a’ bañal bé to we.","For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you."
45,11,22,"Béñge ni loñgeñem i Nyambe lôñni kogse yé. Kogse i yé inyu bôt ba bi kwo, ndi loñgeñem i Nyambe i yé inyu nan, ibale ni nyégle ikété loñge yé ñem; ibale hala bé, a ga kit yak bé.","See, therefore, God’s kindness and severity. Toward those who fell there is severity, but toward you there is God’s kindness, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be lopped off."
45,11,23,"A ga boge yak bo ibale ba nyégle bé ikété ngitophémle yap, inyule Nyambe a nla tiimba boge bo.","They also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again."

45,11,26,"kayéle Israel yosôna y’a tohlana. Ndik kiki i yé ntilga le: “Ntohol a ga lôl i Siôn, a boñ le mbôda Yakôb i tjôô maboñok ma liyan Nyambe.",and in this manner all Israel will be saved. Just as it is written: “The deliverer will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob.
45,11,27,Mana mon ma yé malômbla mem lôñni bo ngéda m’a héya bibéba gwap.”,"And this is the covenant on my part with them, when I take their sins away.”"

45,11,29,Inyule makébla ma Nyambe ni nsébla wé bi ta bé mam le a ga tam.,For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret.

45,11,32,Inyule Nyambe a bi nwas bobasôna lôñ ikété ngimanôgla inyu boñ le a unda bobasôna konangoo.,"For God has shut them all up together in disobedience, that he might show all of them mercy."
45,11,33,"Éé kinje ndip lingwañ li Nyambe li yé, yak pék yé lôñni yi yé! Mbagi yé i nla bé wéna, yak manjel mé ma mbuma ñañ!",O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!
45,11,34,"Inyule “njee a nyi mahoñol ma Yéhôva, tole njee a bi yila ntipék wé?”","For “who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?”"
45,11,35,"Tole: “Njee a bi bôk a ti nye jam, le ndi a timbhe nye jo?”","Or, “Who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?”"
45,11,36,"Inyule mam momasôna ma nlôl i nyeni, ma bak ki ni njel yé, ni inyu yé. Lipém li ba ni nye i boga ni boga. Amen.",Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.
45,11,4,Ndi kii lipôdôl li Nyambe li nkal nye? “Me ngi gwé dikôô di bôt disaambok di di ñumul bé Baal maboñ.”,"Yet, what does the divine pronouncement say to him? “I have left seven thousand men over for myself, men who have not bent the knee to Baal.”"
45,11,5,"Jon nlélém jam yak munu ngéda ini, ngim bon ba Lôk Israel i nyégle, i Nyambe a bi pohol ni njel konangoo yé i mbuma ñañ.","In this way, therefore, at the present season also a remnant has turned up according to a choosing due to undeserved kindness."

45,12,10,"Inyu unda gwéha lisañ li bôt, ni bana ñem gwéha bé ni bé. Ni ba bôt ba bisu i tina lipém bé ni bé.",In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another take the lead.

45,12,13,Ni kabna mam ni gwé lôñni bapubhaga inoñnaga ni mam ma mbéda bo. Ni bana lem i leege bakén.,Share with the holy ones according to their needs. Follow the course of hospitality.
45,12,14,"Kena ni bisu i sayap i bôt ba ntééñga bé; ni sayap, ndi ni tiihe bañ.",Keep on blessing those who persecute; be blessing and do not be cursing.
45,12,15,Kona maséé lôñni ba ba nkon maséé; ni ee ki lôñni ba ba ñee.,Rejoice with people who rejoice; weep with people who weep.
45,12,16,"Ni tôñ bôt bape kiki ni ntôñ bébomede; ni bok bañ mahoñol manan i mam makeñi, ndi nwaha le mam matitigi mon ma éga bé.

Do not become discreet in YOUR own eyes."
45,12,17,Ni timbhe bañ mut nye ki nye béba inyu béba. Hoñlana i boñ i mam ma yé loñge i mis ma bôt bobasôna.,Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men.

45,12,4,"Inyule ndik kiki nyuu i gwé ngandak bijô, ndi bijô gwobisôna bi gwé bé nlélém nson,","For just as we have in one body many members, but the members do not all have the same function,"

45,13,10,"Gwéha i mboñ bé mut wé libôk béba. Jon nu a gwé gwéha, wee a mal yônôs mbén yosôna.",Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore love is the law’s fulfillment.

45,13,14,Ndi noña ndémbél i Nwet le Yésu Kristô; ni hek bañ to pék inyu yônôs minheña mi minsôn.,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh."
45,13,2,"Jon nu ni nu a nkolba ane, wee a yé i kolba bitelbene bi Nyambe; i bôt ba nkolba yo b’a lona kogse i ngii yap bomede.",Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will receive judgment to themselves.

But if you are doing what is bad, be in fear: for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword; for it is God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath upon the one practicing what is bad."
45,13,5,"Jon ni gwé yaga njom i i nyégsa bé i suhus bébomede isi baane, ha ndik inyu hiun hini bé, ndi Yak inyu kiññem nan.","There is therefore compelling reason for YOU people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath but also on account of YOUR conscience."
45,13,6,"Inyu hala nyen ni nsaa yak tas; inyule ba yé bagwelnson ba Nyambe, ba gwelek ki nson wé ngéda yosôna.",For that is why YOU are also paying taxes; for they are God’s public servants constantly serving this very purpose.

45,14,1,"Leegana i mut a gwé hémle i mbomb, ndi ni kéés bañ nye inyule a gwé jé litehge li mam.","Welcome the man having weaknesses in his faith, but not to make decisions on inward questionings."

45,5,6,Inyule ngéda di bé di ngi yii yaga ikété béba nyen Kristô a bi wél inyu bayan Nyambe i ntéak ngéda.,"For, indeed, Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time."
45,5,7,"Inyule hala a yé ndutu le mut a wo inyu mut telepsép; bebek le mut a nla ban ñem, a ba bebee i wo inyu loñge mut.","For hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die."
45,5,8,"Ndi Nyambe a ñunda bés gwéha yé nyemede munu jam lini le, ngéda di bé di ngi yii baboñbéba, Kristô a wél inyu yés.","But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Iloo ki hala, kiki i mal kéla le di téé sép ni njel matjél mé, wee di nla ba nkwoog nkaa le d’a pei hiun hi Nyambe ni njel yé.","Much more, therefore, since we have been declared righteous now by his blood, shall we be saved through him from wrath."
45,6,1,Kii di nla ni kal? Baa di kenek ni bisu i boñ béba inyu boñ le konangoo i mbuma ñañ i kônde bôl?,"Consequently, what shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that undeserved kindness may abound?"
45,6,10,"Inyule i nyemb a bi wo, a bi wél yo inyu héya béba ngélé yada inyu ngélé yosôna; ndi niñ a niñ nano, a niñ inyu boñ sômbôl i Nyambe.","For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time; but the life that he lives, he lives with reference to God."
45,6,11,"Jon yak bé, yoña bébomede le ni yé nwok inyu béba, ndi ni yé i niñ inyu Nyambe ni njel Kristô Yésu.",Likewise also YOU: reckon yourselves to be dead indeed with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus.
45,6,12,"Jon ni nwas bañ le béba i kônde ane manyuu manan ma ma nwo, le ndi ni nôgôl minheña nwap.",Therefore do not let sin continue to rule as king in YOUR mortal bodies that YOU should obey their desires.

45,6,14,"Inyule béba i nlama bé ane bé, hala kiki ni ta bé isi mbén, ndi ni yé isi konangoo i mbuma ñañ.","For sin must not be master over YOU, seeing that YOU are not under law but under undeserved kindness."
45,6,15,"Kii di nla ni kal? Baa di boñok ni béba inyule di ta bé isi mbén, ndi di yé isi konangoo i mbuma ñañ? To jam!",What follows? Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Never may that happen!

45,6,17,"Ndi Nyambe a kôhna mayéga le to hala kiki ni bé minkol mi béba, ni bi unda manôgla ma nlôl i ñem inyu noñ ndémbél biniigana ni bi kôhna.",But thanks to God that YOU were the slaves of sin but YOU became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which YOU were handed over.
45,6,18,"Ñ, kiki ni bi nyodi i mok mi béba, ni bi yila minkol mi telepsép.","Yes, since YOU were set free from sin, YOU became slaves to righteousness."

45,6,21,Limbe litam ni bé num ha ngéda i? Mam ma ma mboñ le ni wo nyuu nano. Inyule lisuk li mam mana li yé nyemb.,"What, then, was the fruit that YOU used to have at that time? Things of which YOU are now ashamed. For the end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"Ndi nano kiki ba bi kobol bé isi béba, ni yila minkol mi Nyambe, ni yé i num litam linan li li yé libak lipubi, ndi lisuk li yé niñ boga.","However, now, because YOU were set free from sin but became slaves to God, YOU are having YOUR fruit in the way of holiness, and the end everlasting life."
45,6,23,"Inyule nsaa u béba u yé nyemb, ndi likébla Nyambe a nti li yé niñ boga ni njel Kristô Yésu Nwet wés.","For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,6,3,"Tole ni nyi bé le bésbobasôna ba di bi kôhna sôble i Kristô Yésu, di bi kôhna sôble i nyemb yé?",Or do YOU not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45,6,4,"Jon di bi juba lôñni nye ni njel sôble yés i nyemb yé, inyu boñ le kiki Kristô a bi tuge ikété bawoga ni njel lipém li Isañ, hala nyen yak bés di nlama niñ niñ mondo.","Therefore we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, we also should likewise walk in a newness of life."
45,6,5,"Ibale di bi mal bana adna ni nye inyule di bi wo kiki nye, ni nlélém njel nyen di ga bana ki adna ni nye inyule d’a tuge kiki nye.","For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection;"

45,6,7,Inyule i mut a nwo a mal saa inyu béba yé.,For he who has died has been acquitted from his sin.
45,6,8,"Handugi hala, ibale di bi wo lôñni Kristô, di nhémle le d’a niñ ki lôñni nye.","Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him."
45,6,9,"Inyule di nyi le, nano kiki Kristô a bi tuge ikété bawoga, a nwo ha bé; nyemb i ñane ha bé to nye.","For we know that Christ, now that he has been raised up from the dead, dies no more; death is master over him no more."
45,7,1,"Baa i nla ba le ni nyi bé, a lôk kéé, (inyule me mpôdôs i bôt ba nyi mbén) le mbén Môsi i ñane mut ntel wonsôna a yé i niñ?","Can it be that YOU do not know, brothers, (for I am speaking to those who know law,) that the Law is master over a man as long as he lives?"
45,7,10,"Yak i mbén i bé lama kena i niñ, me léba le i nkena i nyemb.","And the commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death."
45,7,11,"Inyule ngéda béba i bi léba njel mbén i bi yibil, béba i lop me; i mbus, i nol me ni njel mbén.","For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it."
45,7,12,"Jon, mbén Môsi yomede i yé pubi, yak mbén i yé pubi, i téé sép, i yé ki loñge.","Wherefore, on its part, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good."
45,7,13,"Ndi, baa loñge jam yon i bi nol me? To jam!

Never may that happen! But sin did, that it might be shown as sin working out death for me through that which is good; that sin might become far more sinful through the commandment."
45,7,14,"Inyule di nyi le mbén Môsi i yé yom i mbuu, ndi me me yé yom i minsôn, nuñlak inyu ba nkol u béba.","For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin."
45,7,15,Inyule me nok bé i jam me yé i boñ. Inyule me mbéna bé boñ i jam me nsômbôl boñ; ndi i jam me ñoo jon me mboñ.,"For what I am working out I do not know. For what I wish, this I do not practice; but what I hate is what I do."
45,7,16,"Ndi ibale me mboñ i jam me nsômbôl bé, wee me neebe le mbén Môsi i yé loñge.","However, if what I do not wish is what I do, I agree that the Law is fine."
45,7,17,"Ndi nano, me ha bé nyen me mboñ i mam mana, ndi béba i i yé ikété yem yon i mboñ mo.","But now the one working it out is no longer I, but sin that resides in me."
45,7,18,"Inyule me nyi le loñge yo ki yo i ta bé ikété yem, hala wee ikété minsôn nwem; inyule me gwé ngôñ i boñ i jam li yé loñge ndi me gwé bé ngap i boñ jo.","For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for ability to wish is present with me, but ability to work out what is fine is not present."
45,7,19,"Inyule me mboñ bé i loñge me nsômbôl boñ, ndi i béba me nsômbôl bé boñ, yon me mbéna boñ.","For the good that I wish I do not do, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice."
45,7,2,"Kiki hihéga, mbén i ñat mbiibaga muda ni nlô wé ntel wonsôna nlôm a yé i niñ; ndi ibale nlôm a nwo, a ta ha bé isi mbén i nlôm.","For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law of her husband."
45,7,20,"Jon ibale me mboñ i jam me nsômbôl bé boñ, wee me ha bé nyen me mboñ jo, ndi i béba i yé ikété yem.","If, now, what I do not wish is what I do, the one working it out is no longer I, but the sin dwelling in me."
45,7,21,"Me nléba ni i mbén ini inyu yem le: I ngéda me nsômbôl boñ jam li téé sép, i jam li yé béba jon li yé ikété yem.","I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me."
45,7,22,"Ni maliga, i mut me yé ikété a nkon maséé ni mbén Nyambe,","I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,"
45,7,23,"ndi me ntehe ikété nyuu yem le mbén ipe yon i njôs mbén i mahoñol mem sañ, i ken-ga ki me kiki nkol le me ba isi mbén béba i i yé ikété nyuu yem.",but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.
45,7,24,Kinje ngoo mut me yé! Njee a’ tohol me ni nyuu ini i nkena i nyemb?,Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?
45,7,25,"Nyambe a kôhna mayéga ni njel Nwet wés Yésu Kristô! Jon memede ikété mahoñol mem, me yé nkol u mbén Nyambe; ndi ikété minsôn nwem, me yé nkol u mbén béba.","Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with my flesh to sin’s law."
45,7,3,"Jon ngéda nlôm a yé i niñ, ba ga sébél nye le muda ndéñg ibale a nyila nwaa munlôm numpe. Ndi ibale nlôm a nwo, a ta ha bé isi mbén i nlôm, kayéle a ta bé muda ndéñg ibale a nyila nwaa munlôm numpe.","So, then, while her husband is living, she would be styled an adulteress if she became another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man’s."
45,7,4,"Jon a lôktata, ni bi wo inyu mbén Môsi ni njel nyuu i Kristô, inyu boñ le ni ba bôt ba mut numpe, nu a bi tuge ikété bawoga, le ndi di num matam inyu Nyambe.","So, my brothers, YOU also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ, that YOU might become another’s, the one’s who was raised up from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God."
45,7,5,"Inyule ngéda di bé niñ inoñnaga ni minsôn, ngôñ ibe mbén Môsi i bi tôdôl i bé sal ikété manyuu més i boñ le di num matam inyu nyemb.","For when we were in accord with the flesh, the sinful passions that were excited by the Law were at work in our members that we should bring forth fruit to death."
45,7,6,"Ndi nano, di mal pam i mok mi mbén Môsi inyule di mal wo inyu jam li kéñék bés njel, inyu boñ le di yila minkol i libak li yondo ni njel mbuu mpubi, ndi ha i nlômbi libak ni njel bitilna bi mbén bé.","But now we have been discharged from the Law, because we have died to that by which we were being held fast, that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit, and not in the old sense by the written code."
45,7,7,"Kii di nlama ni kal? Le mbén Môsi i yé béba? To jam! Ni maliga, me bé bé le me pam i yi béba ibale mbén Môsi i ba bé. Kiki hihéga, me bé bé le me yi tama ibale mbén Môsi i kal bé le: “U nlama bé tam.”","What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: “You must not covet.”"
45,7,8,"Ndi ngéda mbén i bi yible béba njel, béba i tôdôl mintén mi tama nwominsôna ikété yem, inyule ngéda mbén i bé bé, yak béba i bé nwok.","But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead."
45,7,9,"Ni maliga, me bé niñ ngéda mbén i bé bé. Ndi ngéda mbén i bi lo, yak béba i lo i niñ, me me wo.","In fact, I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died."
45,8,1,"Jon, i bôt ba yé ikété adna lôñni Kristô Yésu ba nkôhna bé mbagi nôgôs.",Therefore those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation.
45,8,10,"Ndi ibale Kristô a yé ikété adna lôñni bé, wee manyuu manan ma yé nwok inyu béba, ndi mbuu mpubi u nti bé niñ inyu telepsép.","But if Christ is in union with YOU, the body indeed is dead on account of sin, but the spirit is life on account of righteousness."
45,8,11,"Ndi ibale mbuu u nu a bi tugul Yésu ikété bawoga u yé ikété nan, wee nu a bi tugul Kristô Yésu ikété bawoga a’ boñ le yak manyuu manan ma ma nwo ma niñ ni njel mbuu u u yé ikété nan.","If, now, the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in YOU, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make YOUR mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in YOU."
45,8,12,"Jon a lôk kéé, di yé nyégsaga le di niñ bañ inoñnaga ni minsôn, to noñ minheña mi minsôn;","So, then, brothers, we are under obligation, not to the flesh to live in accord with the flesh;"
45,8,13,"Ibale ni niñ inoñnaga ni minsôn, ibabé pééna n’a wo; ndi ibale ni nol maboñok mabe ma nyuu ni njel mbuu mpubi, ki n’a niñ.","for if YOU live in accord with the flesh YOU are sure to die; but if YOU put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, YOU will live."
45,8,14,Inyule bôt bobasôna mbuu u Nyambe u ñéga bon ba yé toi bon ba Nyambe.,"For all who are led by God’s spirit, these are God’s sons."
45,8,15,"Inyule ni bi kôhna bé mbuu inyu ba minkol, mbuu u u ntinde bé i kônde kon woñi; ndi Nyambe a bi ti bé mbuu inyu yilha bé bon bé ngwalakbel, ni njel mbuu unu nyen di nlond le: “Abba, a Ta!”","For YOU did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but YOU received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: “Abba, Father!”"
45,8,16,Mbuu womede u mbok mbôgi ni mbuu wés le di yé bon ba Nyambe.,The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.
45,8,17,"Ndi ibale di yé bon, wee di yé ki bakôdôlbum, ñ, bakôdôlbum ba Nyambe yaga, ndi baso bakôdôlbum ni Kristô, ibale di nok ndutu kiki nye, inyu boñ le di kôhna nlélém lipém kiki nye.","If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together."
45,8,18,Inyule me ntehe le mandutu ma ngéda ini ma ta bé to jam i bisu bi lipém li l’a yeelana ni njel yés.,Consequently I reckon that the sufferings of the present season do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us.
45,8,19,Inyule i mam ma bi héga ma nyégi i bem masoola ma bon ba Nyambe.,For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.
45,8,2,"Inyule mbén i mbuu u u nti niñ ni njel Kristô Yésu yon i bi kobol we isi mbén béba, ni isi mbén nyemb.",For the law of that spirit which gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
45,8,20,"Inyule i mam ma bi héga ma bi yila yañga, ha inyu sômbôl yap bé, ndi inyu sômbôl i nu a bi nwas le ma yila yañga, ndi a ti ki botñem","For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but through him that subjected it, on the basis of hope"
45,8,21,"le i mam momede ma bi héga m’a koblana le ma ba ha bañ minkol mi nyuu i i ntjiba, ndi m’a bana kunde ikété lipém li bon ba Nyambe.",that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.
45,8,22,"Inyule di nyi le i mam momasôna ma bi héga ma nwaa bé tjelel, to nok njôghe lôñ letee ni bilen.",For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.
45,8,23,"Handugi hala, ndi yak bésbomede ba di gwé matam ma bisu, hala wee mbuu mpubi, ñ, bésbomede di ntjelel ikété yés, hala kiki di nyégi i bem le di yila bon ngwalakbel ngéda d’a pam i mok mi manyuu més ma minsôn ni njel binoñ.","Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves, while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom."
45,8,24,"Inyule di bi tohlana munu botñem ini; ndi botñem i ba ntehe i ta ha bé botñem; inyule ngéda mut a ntehe jam, baa a gwé ki botñem le li ga lo?","For we were saved in this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for when a man sees a thing, does he hope for it?"
45,8,25,"Ndi ibale di gwé botñem inyu jam di ntehe bé, di nwaa bé bem jo ni hônba.","But if we hope for what we do not see, we keep on waiting for it with endurance."
45,8,26,"Hala nyen yak mbuu mpubi u nhôla bés ikété bibomb gwés; inyule ndutu i yé le, ngéda di gwé ngôñ i soohe, di nyi bé lelaa di soohe kiki i mbéda, ndi mbuu mpubi u nyemhe inyu yés ngéda di ntjelel ikété miñem.","In like manner the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the problem of what we should pray for as we need to we do not know, but the spirit itself pleads for us with groanings unuttered."
45,8,27,"Ndi Nyambe nu a nwan miñem a nyi i jam mbuu mpubi u mbat inyu bapubhaga, inyule hala a yé inoñnaga ni sômbôl Nyambe.","Yet he who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in accord with God for holy ones."
45,8,28,"Di nyi le Nyambe a mboñ le minson nwé nwominsôna mi sal ikété adna inyu loñge i ba ba ngwés Nyambe, hala wee ba ba nséblana inoñnaga ni sômbôl yé;","Now we know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God, those who are the ones called according to his purpose;"
45,8,29,"inyule a bi téé i bisu bi ngéda le i bôt a bi bôk a pohol ba nlama ba i pôna i Man wé, le ndi a ba mbôkgwéé ipôla ngandak lôkisañ.","because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
45,8,3,"I jam mbén Môsi i bi la bé boñ inyule i bé bomb inyu libak li kwéha li mut binam, jo yaga jon Nyambe a bi boñ ngéda a bi ep Man wé nyemede i pôna i mut binam nu a yé kwéha inyu sas bibéba, ni inyu kéés béba i i yé ikété minsôn,","For, there being an incapability on the part of the Law, while it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,"
45,8,30,"Handugi hala, i bôt a bi téé i bisu bi ngéda, bo ki bon a bi sébél; yak ba a bi sébél, bo ki bon a bi kal le ba téé sép. Sôk i nsôk, i bôt a bi kal le ba téé sép, bo ki bon a bi ti lipém.","Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous. Finally those whom he declared righteous are the ones he also glorified."
45,8,31,"Kii ni di nlama kal inyu mam mana? Ibale Nyambe a yé lôñni bés, njee a’ kolba bés?","What, then, shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who will be against us?"
45,8,32,"Hala kiki a bi bañal bé to Man wé nyemede, ndi a ti nye inyu bésbobasôna, baa nye lôñni Man wé b’a ti bé bés i mam mape mana momasôna ni loñgeñem?","He who did not even spare his own Son but delivered him up for us all, why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things?"
45,8,33,Njee a ga ôm mimpohlak mi Nyambe nsohi? Nyambe nyen a yé Nu a nkal le ba téé sép.,Who will file accusation against God’s chosen ones? God is the One who declares them righteous.
45,8,34,"Njee a’ pémhene bo mbagi nôgôs? Kristô Yésu nyen a yé nu a bi wo, ñ, iloo ki hala, a yé ki nu a bi tuge; nyen a yé i woo walôm u Nyambe, nye ki nyen a nyemhe inyu yés.","Who is he that will condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, rather the one who was raised up from the dead, who is on the right hand of God, who also pleads for us."
45,8,35,"Njee a ga bagal bés ni gwéha i Kristô? Baa njiiha, tole nduña, tole ndééñga, tole njal, tole liyep li mambot, tole hiandi, tole pansoñ?",Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?
45,8,36,Ndik kiki i yé ntilga le: “Inyu yoñ nyen ba nôlôl bés kel yosôna; di bi éña kiki mintômba le mi nlama nôla.”,"Just as it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.”"
45,8,37,"Ndi lôñni mahôla ma nu a bi gwés bés, di nyémbél i mam mana momasôna yémbél yosôna.","To the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us."
45,8,38,"Inyule me yé nkwoog nkaa le to nyemb, to niñ, to biañgel, to bangomin, to mam ma yé hanano, to mam m’a ke i lo, to ngui,",For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers
45,8,39,"to ngii, to ndip, to hégél ipe yo ki yo i ga la bé bagal bés ni gwéha Nyambe i i yé i Kristô Yésu Nwet wés.",nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45,8,4,"inyu boñ le matéak ma téé sép ma mbén Môsi ma yônôl bés ba di nke bé inoñnaga ni minsôn, ndi inoñnaga ni mbuu mpubi.","that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk, not in accord with the flesh, but in accord with the spirit."

46,10,5,"Ndi to hala, libim ikété yap li bi lémél bé Nyambe, jon a bi nol bo i ñoñ.","Nevertheless, on most of them God did not express his approval, for they were laid low in the wilderness."

46,11,20,"I ngéda ni nkodba ngim homa, ni nkodba toi bé inyu je Bilôp bi Nwet.","Therefore, when YOU come together to one place, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s evening meal."

46,11,23,"Inyule i jam Nwet a bi ti me jon me bi lôôs bé, le i u ba bé lama liibana Nwet le Yésu, a bi yoñ bret,","For I received from the Lord that which I also handed on to YOU, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf"

46,11,26,"Inyule hiki ngéda ni nje bret bini, ni nyok mu libôndô lini, ni nke ni bisu i añal nyemb i Nwet letee a lo.","For as often as YOU eat this loaf and drink this cup, YOU keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives."
46,11,27,"Jon nu ni nu a nje bret, tole a nyo mu libôndô li Nwet ki le a kôli bé, a’ bana kogse inyule a nyan nyuu ni matjél ma Nwet.",Consequently whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord.
46,11,28,"Mut a bôk ndugi a wan nyemede inyu tehe too a kôli, i mbus hala ndik nyen a nla je bret ni nyo mu libôndô.","First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and thus let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup."
46,11,29,"Inyule i mut a nje ni nyo ibabé i yi mahee ma nyuu, a nje, a nyok mbagi nôgôs ikolba nyemede.",For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment against himself if he does not discern the body.
46,11,3,Ndi me nsômbôl le ni yi le ñane hiki munlôm a yé Kristô; ni le ñane muda a yé munlôm; ndi ñane Kristô a yé Nyambe.,But I want YOU to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.
46,11,30,"Inyu hala nyen ngandak ikété nan i mbomb, i konok, ngandak ki i nke ’ilo ikété nyemb.","That is why many among YOU are weak and sickly, and quite a few are sleeping in death."

46,11,7,"Munlôm a nlama bé hô ño wé inyule a yé pôna Nyambe ni lipém jé, ndi muda a yé lipém li munlôm.","For a man ought not to have his head covered, as he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is man’s glory."
46,11,8,"Inyule munlôm a bi lôl bé yak muda, ndi muda nyen a bi lôl yak munlôm.","For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;"
46,11,9,"Handugi hala, munlôm a bi héga bé inyu muda, ndi muda nyen a bi héga inyu munlôm.","and, what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man."
46,12,1,"Ndi inyu makébla ma mbuu, a lôk kéé, me ngwés bé le ni ba kiki bôt le ba gwé bé yi.","Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want YOU to be ignorant."

46,15,16,"Inyule ibale bawoga ba nlama bé tuge, wee to Kristô a bi tuge bé.","For if the dead are not to be raised up, neither has Christ been raised up."

46,9,23,"Ndi me mboñ mam momasôna inyu ñañ nlam, le ndi me añle wo bôt bape.","But I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with others."

Now they, of course, do it that they may get a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one."
46,9,26,"Jon, me nke bé ngwéé wengoñle me nyi bé homa me nke; me ñôm ki bikut gwem kayéle me bép bañ mbebi;","Therefore, the way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air;"

Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat some of the milk of the flock?
46,9,8,Baa me mpot ndik i mam mana ni litehge li mut binam? Baa yak mbén Môsi i mpot bé i mam mana?,Am I speaking these things by human standards? Or does not the Law also say these things?
46,9,9,Inyule i yé ntilga ikété mbén Môsi le: “U nlama bé kañ nlôm nyaga nyo ngéda a ntét blé.” Baa nyaga yon Nyambe a ntôñ?,For in the law of Moses it is written: “You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain.” Is it bulls God is caring for?
47,1,1,"Me Paul, ñôma nu Kristô inoñnaga ni sômbôl i Nyambe, lôñni Timôtéô mankéé wés, me ntilna likoda li Nyambe li li yé i Korintô, yak ni bapubhaga bobasôna ba ba yé i Akaya yosôna:","Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will, and Timothy our brother to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, together with all the holy ones who are in all of Achaia:"

47,1,13,"Inyule di ta yaga bé i tilna bé mam mape handugi mam ni nla añ, ni nogok ki; me gwé ki botñem le n’a kônde nok i mam mana i nya i yôni,","For we are really not writing YOU things except those which YOU well know or also recognize; and which I hope YOU will continue to recognize to the end,"

47,1,15,"Ni ini botñem nyen me bé gwés le me lo ndugi i bééni, kayéle ni kon maséé inyu ngélé i nyônôs iba;","So, with this confidence, I was intending before to come to YOU, that YOU might have a second occasion for joy,"

Or what things I purpose, do I purpose them according to the flesh, that with me there should be “Yes, Yes” and “No, No”?"
47,1,18,"Ndi di nla bôdôl Nyambe ñem munu jam lini le, i mam di bi kal bé ma ta bé “ñ”, ndi ma bak “to.”",But God can be relied upon that our speech addressed to YOU is not Yes and yet No.
47,1,19,"Inyule Yésu Kristô, Man Nyambe nu di bi añal ipôla nan, hala wee me ni Silvanô lôñni Timôtéô, “ñ” wé a bi yila bé “to,” ndi “ñ” wé a bi yila “ñ.”","For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among YOU through us, that is, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become Yes and yet No, but Yes has become Yes in his case."
47,1,2,Konangoo i mbuma ñañ ni nsañ bi nlôl yak Nyambe Tata wés lôñni Nwet le Yésu Kristô bi ba ni bé.,May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Jon ni njel yé ki nyen di nkal Nyambe le “Amen”, le ndi Nyambe a kôhna lipém ni njel yés.","For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him. Therefore also through him is the “Amen” said to God for glory through us."
47,1,21,"Ndi Nyambe nyen a mbogye le bé ni bés di yé ba Kristô, nye ki nyen a bi yilha bés minhook.",But he who guarantees that YOU and we belong to Christ and he who has anointed us is God.
47,1,22,"A bi ha ki béndél yé i ngii yés, a ti ki bés bibep bi mam ma nlama lo ikété miñem nwés, hala wee mbuu mpubi.","He has also put his seal upon us and has given us the token of what is to come, that is, the spirit, in our hearts."
47,1,23,"Nano me nsébél Nyambe le a ba mbôgi ikolba memede, le inyu sôñ bé nyen me yé ngi lo i Korintô.",Now I call upon God as a witness against my own soul that it is to spare YOU that I have not yet come to Corinth.
47,1,24,"Hala a ngwés bé kal le di ñane hémle nan, ndi di yé baso bagwelnson inyu maséé manan, inyule ni njel hémle nan nyen ni téé bitétéé.","Not that we are the masters over YOUR faith, but we are fellow workers for YOUR joy, for it is by YOUR faith that YOU are standing."
47,1,3,"Bibégés bi ba ni Nyambe ni Isañ Nwet wés Yésu Kristô, Tata nu a yôni ni konangoo, ni Nyambe nu hogbe yosôna,","Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort,"

47,1,5,"Inyule nlélém kiki mandutu més inyu Kristô ma mbôl, hala ki nyen yak hogbe di nkôhna ni njel Kristô i mbôl.","For just as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so the comfort we get also abounds through the Christ."

47,1,7,"Yak botñem yés inyu nan i mpiñgla bé, di yik le ndik kiki ni nyoñ ngaba i mandutu, hala nyen n’a yoñ ki ngaba i hogbe.","And so our hope for YOU is unwavering, knowing as we do that, just as YOU are sharers of the sufferings, in the same way YOU will also share the comfort."
47,1,8,"Inyule, a lôk kéé, di ngwés bé sôô bé i njiiha di bi kôhna i pes mbok Asia.

47,1,9,"Ni maliga, di bi nôgda le di bi kôhna mbagi nyemb. Hala a bé inyu boñ le di bôdôl bañ bésbomede ñem, ndik Nyambe nu a ntugul bawoga.","In fact, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death. This was that we might have our trust, not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead."
47,10,1,"Me Paul, memede yaga nyen me yé i soohe bé ni njel ñemlima ni loñgeñem i Kristô, to hala kiki me nene yañga mut ngéda me yé i bisu binan, ndi me gwé makénd ikolba bé ngéda me ta bé ha.","Now I myself, Paul, entreat YOU by the mildness and kindness of the Christ, lowly though I am in appearance among YOU, whereas when absent I am bold toward YOU."
47,10,10,"Inyule bôt bahogi ba nkal le: “Bikaat gwé bi nyét, bi gwé ki ngui, ndi ngéda nyemede a yé ha, a ñét bé, yak bibañga gwé bi nhoi.”","For, say they: “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible.”"
47,10,11,"I nya mut ini i yi le i jam di nkal ikété bikaat gwés ngéda di ta bé ha, jon d’a boñ ngéda di mba ha.","Let such a man take this into account, that what we are in our word by letters when absent, such we shall also be in action when present."

Certainly they in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves have no understanding.
47,10,13,"Ndi bés d’a kadba bé inyu nkoñ u yé i mbus minwaa Nyambe a bi hégél bés, ndi ndik inyu nson di ngwel ikété minwaa mi nkoñ Nyambe a nti bés, a boñok le u pam letee ni nyoo bééni.","For our part we will boast, not outside our assigned boundaries, but according to the boundary of the territory that God apportioned to us by measure, making it reach even as far as YOU."

Then we will abound still more,"
47,10,16,"kayéle di añal ñañ nlam i biloñ bi yé nyoo i mbus nan, le ndi di kadba bañ inyu nson u u mal bôña ikété nkoñ u mut numpe.","to declare the good news to the countries beyond YOU, so as not to boast in someone else’s territory where things are already prepared."

47,10,18,"Inyule i mut a mbôgôl nyemede mbôgi lam, ha nye bé nyen a nlémél Nyambe, ndi nu Yéhôva a mbôgôl mbôgi lam.","For not the one who recommends himself is approved, but the man whom Jehovah recommends."

47,10,3,"Inyule to hala kiki di niñ ikété minsôn, di njo bé gwét inoñnaga ni minsôn.","For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh."
47,10,4,"Inyule bijôl gwés bi gwét bi ta bé bi minsôn, ndi Nyambe nyen a nti gwo ngui inyu bôk minkum mi mandap.","For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things."
47,10,5,"Inyule di nhielel bipék ni hiki jam li ntelep ikolba yi Nyambe, di nkena mahoñol momasôna i minkôm inyu boñ le ma nôgôl Kristô;",For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ;
47,10,6,di yé ki nkôôbaga i kogse ngimanôgla yosôna ngéda ni mal unda le bébomede ni yé manôgla i nya i yôni.,"and we are holding ourselves in readiness to inflict punishment for every disobedience, as soon as YOUR own obedience has been fully carried out."

If anyone trusts in himself that he belongs to Christ, let him again take this fact into account for himself, that, just as he belongs to Christ, so do we also."
47,10,8,"Inyule to ibale me nlama kadba ndék jôga inyu kunde Nwet a bi ti bés inyu lédés bé, ha inyu tômbôs bé bé, ki m’a wo bé nyuu.","For even if I should boast a bit too much about the authority that the Lord gave us to build YOU up and not to tear YOU down, I would not be put to shame,"
47,10,9,Inyule me gwé bé ngôñ le i nene wengoñle me nsômbôl kônha bé woñi ni bikaat gwem.,that I may not seem to want to terrify YOU by my letters.

47,11,13,"Inyule i nya bôt ini i yé baôma ba bitembee, bagwelnson ba malôga, ba ba nhéñba le ba yé baôma ba Kristô.","For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"Hala a ta bé jam li hélha, inyule yak Satan nyemede a nwaa bé héñba le a yé añgel i mapubi.","And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light."

Ndi lisuk jap l’a ba inoñnaga ni minson nwap.,It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. But their end shall be according to their works.
47,11,16,"Me ntiimba kal le: Mut to wada a hoñol bañ le me yé jôñ mut.

Still, if YOU really do, accept me even if as unreasonable, that I too may do some little boasting."
47,11,17,"Ndi nano me ta ha bé i pot inoñnaga ni ndémbél Nwet, ndi kiki jôñ mut i i mbôdôl yomede ñem, i kadbaga ki.","What I speak I speak, not after the Lord’s example, but as in unreasonableness, in this cocksureness peculiar to boasting."

47,11,19,"I kal ni nkal le ni yé “bôt ba nhek pék,” baa inyu hala nyen ni nkon maséé i nihbe bijôñ bi bôt?","For YOU gladly put up with the unreasonable persons, seeing YOU are reasonable."

47,4,5,"Inyule di ntéé bé likalô inyu bésbomede, ndi inyu libak le Yésu Kristô a yé Nwet, bésbomede di bak minkol minan inyu Yésu.","For we are preaching, not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as YOUR slaves for Jesus’ sake."

47,9,1,"Ndi inyu nson unu inyu bapubhaga, i ta yaga bé nseñ le me tilna bé,","Now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write YOU,"

47,9,6,"Ndi munu jam lini, nu ni nu a nwes ndék mbôô a ga bumbul ndik ndék, ndi nu ni nu a nwes ngandak mbôô a ga bumbul ki ngandak.","But as to this, he that sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."

48,3,23,"Ndi ilole hémle i nlo, mbén yon i bé tééda bés, di bak i mok, di bemek hémle i i bé bebee ni soolana.","However, before the faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being delivered up together into custody, looking to the faith that was destined to be revealed."
48,3,24,"Jon mbén Môsi i bi yila ntééda wés nu a nkena bés yak Kristô, le ndi i kéla le di téé sép ni njel hémle.","Consequently the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith."
48,3,25,"Ndi nano nu hémle i nlo, di ta ha bé isi ntééda.","But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a tutor."
48,3,26,Bébobasôna ni yé yaga bon ba Nyambe ni njel hémle ni nhémle Kristô Yésu.,"YOU are all, in fact, sons of God through YOUR faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"Inyule bébobasôna ba ni bi kôhna nlélém sôble kiki Kristô, ni bi yila kiki Kristô.",For all of YOU who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

48,4,28,"Jon, a lôk kéé, ni yé bon inoñnaga ni mbônga, nlélém kiki Isak.","Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was."

58,10,3,"Ndi bisesema bini bi nhôñlaha bibéba hiki nwii,","To the contrary, by these sacrifices there is a reminding of sins from year to year,"
58,10,30,Inyule di nyi Nu a bi kal le: “Mapuna ma yé mem; men m’a timbhe.” A bi kal ki le: “Yéhôva a’ kéés litén jé.”,For we know him that said: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense”; and again: “Jehovah will judge his people.”

58,10,4,inyule matjél ma balôm ba nyaga ni ma bibép bi kembee ma nla bé héya bibéba.,for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.

58,10,9,"I mbus, a nkal le: “Nun-ki, me nlo le me boñ sômbôl yoñ.” A mélés jam li bisu inyu téé jam li nyônôs iba.",then he actually says: “Look! I am come to do your will.” He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second.

58,11,14,Inyule i bôt ba mpot i nya ini ba ñunda toi le ba mboñ biliya bi ngui i yéñ homa nu a yé wap.,For those who say such things give evidence that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own.
58,11,15,"To hala, ibale ba kida i hoñol i homa ba bi nyodne, ki ba bi bana pôla i témb nyoo.","And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that place from which they had gone forth, they would have had opportunity to return."

58,11,18,"to hala kiki i bi kéla nye le: “I yom y’a séblana le mbôda yoñ, y’a lo ni njel Isak.”",although it had been said to him: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.”
58,11,19,"Ndi a bi kalba le Nyambe a bé yak le a tugul Isak ikété bawoga, a leege yaga ki nye wengoñle a nlôl i nyemb, le hala a ba yimbne.",But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.
58,11,2,Inyu hémle nyen bôt ba kôba ba bi kôhna mbôgi ilam.,For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.
58,11,20,Inyu hémle nyen Yak isak a bi sayap Yakôb bo Ésau inyu mam ma bé lama lo.,By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

58,11,24,"Inyu hémle nyen, ngéda Môsi a bi nañ, a tjél le ba sébél nye le man ngond Faraô,","By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh,"

58,11,26,"inyule a bi tehe le wonyuu Kristô i yé lingwañ li nloo masôô ma nkus ma Égiptô, inyule a bi tibil bok bibom mis.",because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.
58,11,27,"Inyu hémle nyen a bi nyodi i Égiptô, ndi a kon bé hiun hi kiñe woñi, inyule a bi ke ni bisu i téñbe wengoñle a ntehe Nu a nene bé.","By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible."

Bés bon di yé ndap Yé, ibale di ntéñbe yaga letee ni lisuk ni kunde yés i pot, yak ni botñem di ngôgbene.","but Christ was faithful as a Son over the house of that One. We are the house of that One, if we make fast our hold on our freeness of speech and our boasting over the hope firm to the end."
58,3,7,"Jon kiki mbuu mpubi u mpot: “Len, ibale ni nok kiñ yé,","For this reason, just as the holy spirit says: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice,"
58,3,8,"ni lédés bañ miñem minan kiki i bi bôña i dilo di manoodana i ñoñ, ngéda ba bi nyumbla me le me bep unup,","do not harden YOUR hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger, as in the day of making the test in the wilderness,"
58,3,9,"i homa basôgôlsôgôl banan ba bi noode me, ba suu ki me, to hala kiki ba bi tehe minson nwem môm ma-na ma nwii.","in which YOUR forefathers made a test of me with a trial, and yet they had seen my works for forty years."
58,4,1,"Jon, hala kiki mbônga i jôp ikété noi yé u ngi yii, wee di yoñ yihe, tiga le wada ikété nan a nene wengoñle a nimis wo.","Therefore, since a promise is left of entering into his rest, let us fear that sometime someone of YOU may seem to have fallen short of it."
58,4,10,"Inyule i mut a bi jôp ikété noi i Nyambe, yak nye a noi inyu minson nwé nyemede, kiki Nyambe nyemede a bi boñ inyu minson nwé.","For the man that has entered into God’s rest has also himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his own."
58,4,11,"Jon di boñ ni biliya gwés gwobisôna i jôp ikété noi ini, le ndi mut to wada a noñ bañ nlélém ndémbél ndok.","Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, for fear anyone should fall in the same pattern of disobedience."
58,4,12,"Inyule Bañga i Nyambe i yé yômi, i gwé ki ngui, i nhoo iloo pansoñ yo ki yo i malo ima, i njôp ikété kété letee i bagal mut ni mahoñol, yak ni môñga lôñni poños bihés, i nla ki wan mahoñol lôñni bipék bi ñem.","For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and their marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart."
58,4,13,"Jam to jada li li bi héga li sôli bé i mis mé, ndi mam momasôna ma yé nso, ma bémbi ki i mis ma nu bésbobasôna di nlama ti ñañga.","And there is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting."
58,4,14,"Jon, kiki di gwé prisi keñi i i bi ke i ngii, Man Nyambe le Yésu, wee di téñbege i pahal hémle yés inyu yé.","Seeing, therefore, that we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold onto our confessing of him."
58,4,15,"Inyule di gwé bé prisi keñi i i nla bé nok bibomb gwés, ndi di gwé i i bi noodana ikété manjel momasôna kiki bés, ibabé nye i boñ béba.","For we have as high priest, not one who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in all respects like ourselves, but without sin."
58,4,16,"Jon di kôôge bebee ni yééne ane i konangoo i mbuma ñañ lôñni makénd, kayéle di kôhna konangoo, di léba ki konangoo i mbuma ñañ inyu hôla bés i loñge ngéda.","Let us, therefore, approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness, that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time."
58,4,2,"Inyule ba bi añle yak bés ñañ nlam, ndik kiki ba bi añle yak bo; ndi bañga ba bi nok i bi bane bé bo nseñ, inyule ba bi bana bé nlélém hémle kiki i bôt ba bi emble.","For we have had the good news declared to us also, even as they also had; but the word which was heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who did hear."
58,4,3,"Inyule i bés ba di bi unda le di nhémle, di njôp toi ikété noi ini, nlélém kiki a bi kal le: “Jon me bi kum soñ ikété hiun hiem le: ‘B’a jôp bé ikété noi yem,’” to hala kiki a bi mal boñ minson nwé ilole nkoñ ’isi u mbôdôl.","For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world."
58,4,4,"Inyule a bi pot ikété tilna yada inyu hilo hi nyônôs isaambok le: “Nyambe a bi noi i hilo hi nyônôs isaambok inyu minson nwé nwominsôna,”","For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”"
58,4,5,a nkônde ki kal hana homa nunu le: “B’a jôp bé ikété noi yem.”,and again in this place: “They shall not enter into my rest.”
58,4,6,"Jon, kiki njel i ngi yii inyu bôt bahogi le ba jôp ikété noi yé, hala kiki i bôt ñañ nlam u bi bôk añlana ba bi jôp bé mu inyu ndok yap,","Since, therefore, it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,"
58,4,7,"a bi témb a téé hilo hipe ngéda a bi kal i mbus ntandaa ngéda ikété hiémbi hi David le: “Len”; kiki i mbôk i kéla le: “Len, ibale ni nok kiñ yé, ni lédés bañ miñem minan.”","he again marks off a certain day by saying after so long a time in David’s psalm “Today”; just as it has been said above: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice, do not harden YOUR hearts.”"
58,4,8,"Inyule ibale Yôsua a jôbna bo i homa noi, ki Nyambe a bi pot bé inyu hilo hipe i mbus ngéda.","For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward have spoken of another day."
58,4,9,Jon noi i Sabat ipe i ngi yii inyu litén li Nyambe.,So there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God.
58,5,1,"Inyule hiki prisi keñi i i nyôña ipôla bôt ba binam i ntééba inyu yap i gwel nson Nyambe, le i ti makébla ni bisesema inyu bibéba.","For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men over the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
58,5,10,inyule Nyambe a bi pohol nye le a ba prisi keñi i libak li Melkisédek.,because he has been specifically called by God a high priest according to the manner of Melchizedek.
58,5,11,"Di gwé ngandak mam i kal inyu yé, ndi ma nlet i toñol, inyule ni nyila bôt ba ba ntiñha i noga.","Concerning him we have much to say and hard to be explained, since YOU have become dull in YOUR hearing."

58,5,13,Inyule i mut a nke ni bisu i nyuñ milik a nyi bé bañga i telepsép inyule a yé mañge ntitigi.,"For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe."

58,5,2,"A nla ki unda ñem ngôô inyu bôt ba ngiyi ni minyômôk mi bôt, inyule yak nyemede a gwé gwé bibomb,","He is able to deal moderately with the ignorant and erring ones since he also is surrounded with his own weakness,"
58,5,3,"inyu hala nyen a nlama ti makébla inyu bibéba gwé nyemede, nlélém kiki a mboñ inyu bibéba bi litén.",and on its account he is obliged to make offerings for sins as much for himself as for the people.
58,5,4,"Mut a nyoñ bé lipém lini ni nyemede, ndi a nkôhna ndik jo ngéda Nyambe a ntéé nye, ndik kiki a bi téé Arôn.","Also, a man takes this honor, not of his own accord, but only when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was."
58,5,5,"Jon to Kristô a bi yoñ bé lipém lini ni nyemede ngéda a bi yila prisi keñi, ndi a bi kôhna lipém ni njel Nu a bi kal nye le: “U yé man wem; i len ini, me nyila isoñ.”","So too the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference to him: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.”"
58,5,6,Kiki a nkal ki homa numpe le: “U yé prisi i boga ni boga i libak li Melkisédek.”,Just as he says also in another place: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.”
58,5,7,"I ngéda a bé niñ hana ’isi, Kristô a bi ti minyemhe ni mayagal, ni minlondok mi ngui lôñni gwiiha i bisu bi Nu a bééna ngui i tohol nye i nyemb, a bi kôhna ki ndimbhe inyu masoohe mé inyu woñi a bé kon Nyambe woñi.","In the days of his flesh Christ offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death, with strong outcries and tears, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear."
58,5,8,"To hala kiki a bé man wé, a bi nigil manôgla ni njel mandutu a bi kôhna.","Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered;"
58,5,9,"Ndi ngéda a bi mal témb peles, a yila njel tohi i boga inyu bôt bobasôna ba ba nôgôl nye,","and after he had been made perfect he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him,"

58,6,10,"Inyule Nyambe a ta bé mut a téé bé sép le a hôya nson nan ni gwéha ni ñunda inyu jôl jé, hala kiki ni bi gwélél bapubhaga nson, ni nke ki ni bisu i gwélél bo nson.","For God is not unrighteous so as to forget YOUR work and the love YOU showed for his name, in that YOU have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering."
58,6,11,"Ndi di gwé ngôñ le hiki wada nan a unda minlélém mi makénd i bôlô, le ndi ni ba nkwoog nkaa ni botñem nan i nya i yôni letee ni lisuk,","But we desire each one of YOU to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end,"

58,6,13,"Inyule ngéda Nyambe a bi ti Abraham mbônga, kiki a bé bé le a kum soñ ni mut nu a nloo nye, a bi kum soñ ni nyemede,","For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"a kal le: “M’a sayap yaga we, m’a bulus yaga ki we.”","saying: “Assuredly in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you.”"
58,6,15,Jon ngéda Abraham a bi unda wongut nyen a bi kôhna mbônga unu.,"And thus after Abraham had shown patience, he obtained this promise."
58,6,16,"Inyule mut binam a nkum soñ ni mut nu a nloo nye; i ngéda a mal kum soñ, wee lisuk li ndañ li, inyule hala a yé bibep inyu yé.","For men swear by the one greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, as it is a legal guarantee to them."

58,6,18,"kayéle ni njel i mam mana mo ima ma ma nla bé set, Nyambe a nla bé tembee mu mam ma, bés ba di bi jôp ngwéé ikété lisolbene, di bana ngandak makénd inyu kabda i botñem i téé bés i bisu.","in order that, through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to lay hold on the hope set before us."
58,6,19,"Di gwé i botñem ini kiki hikoba hi sitima inyu biniñ gwés, i nla bé set, i umi ki siñ, i njôbna ki bés letee ni mbus libadô,","This hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain,"

58,6,4,"Inyule i bôt ba bi mal tehe mapubi, ba noode ki likébla li nlôl i ngii, li Nyambe a nti yañga, ba kôhna ki mbuu mpubi,","For it is impossible as regards those who have once for all been enlightened, and who have tasted the heavenly free gift, and who have become partakers of holy spirit,"
58,6,5,"ba noode yak lipôdôl lilam li Nyambe, ni mimpémba mi mam mi nkoñ ’isi u u nlo,","and who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things,"

58,6,8,"Ndi ibale hi nti ndik biloo ni kai ibe, ba ntjôô hio, ba bak bebee i tiihe hio, ba sôk ki ba ligis hio.","But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed; and it ends up with being burned."
58,6,9,"Ndi a bagwéha, to hala kiki di mpot hala, di yé nkwoog nkaa inyu nan ni mam ma yé yaga malam, mam ma nkena i tohi.","However, in YOUR case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things and things accompanied with salvation, although we are speaking in this way."
58,7,1,"Inyule i Melkisédek nunu, kiñe Salem, prisi i Nyambe Nungingii, nyen a bi boma Abraham i matémb mé ngéda a bi mal nol bikiñe, a sayap Abraham;","For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him"
58,7,10,inyule a bé ngi gwéé ikété mbôda sôgôlsôgôl wé ngéda Melkisédek a bi boma Abraham.,for he was still in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met him.

58,7,12,"Inyule kiki ba yé i héñha nson prisi, wee i yé nseñ le ba héñha yak mbén Môsi.","For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law."
58,7,13,"Inyule i mut ba mpôdôl i mam mana a bi lôl i litén lipe; mu litén li, mut to wada a bi gwel bé nson i juu li bisesema.","For the man respecting whom these things are said has been a member of another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar."
58,7,14,"Inyule i nyiba loñge loñge le Nwet wés a nlôl i litén li Yuda, ndi Môsi a bi pot bé jam jo ki jo le biprisi bi nlôl mu litén li.","For it is quite plain that our Lord has sprung up out of Judah, a tribe about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests."
58,7,15,"Ndi hala a bi kônde ki yiba ibabé pééna ngéda prisi ipe i bi nene, i i yé kiki Melkisédek,","And it is still more abundantly clear that with a similarity to Melchizedek there arises another priest,"

58,7,17,Inyule tilna yada i mbok mbôgi inyu yé le: “U yé prisi i boga ni boga i libak li Melkisédek.”,for in witness it is said: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.”
58,7,18,"Jon Nyambe a bi mélés nlômbi mbén inyule i mbomb, i nla bé to hôla bés.","Certainly, then, there occurs a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and ineffectiveness."
58,7,19,"Inyule mbén Môsi i bi yilha bé yom yo ki yo peles, ndi malo ma bañga botñem ma bi yilha mam peles, ni i njel ini ki nyen di nkôôge bebee ni Nyambe.","For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in besides of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God."
58,7,2,"Abraham a bi ti nye jôga jada ikété jôm li gwom gwé gwobisôna. Jam li bisu, jôl jé li nkobla le “Kiñe Telepsép,” a bak ki kiñe Salem, hala wee “Kiñe Nsañ.”","and to whom Abraham apportioned a tenth from all things, is first of all, by translation, “King of Righteousness,” and is then also king of Salem, that is, “King of Peace.”"

58,7,22,hala nyen yak Yésu a bi yila bibep bi bañga malômbla.,to that extent also Jesus has become the one given in pledge of a better covenant.

58,7,25,"Inyu hala nyen a nla tohol i nya i yôni ba ba nkôôge Nyambe bebee ni njel yé, inyule a niñ ngéda yosôna i yemhe inyu yap.","Consequently he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them."

58,7,28,"Inyule i bôt ba gwé bibomb bon mbén Môsi i ntéé kiki biprisi bikeñi; ndi i mbus mbén Môsi, lipôdôl li soñ ba bi kum jon li ntéé Man, nu a bi yila peles i boga ni boga.","for the Law appoints men high priests having weakness, but the word of the sworn oath that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is perfected forever."
58,7,3,"Mut to wada a nyi bé isañ to nyañ, to kaat yé lihaa, to bibôdle bi dilo tjé, to lisuk li niñ yé, ndi a bi yila wengoñle Man Nyambe; jon a nyégle prisi ngélé yada inyu yosôna.","In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually."
58,7,4,"Nuna-ki lelaa i mut nunu a bé bañga mut, nyen isañ lihaa le Abraham a bi ti jôga jada ikété jôm li tik gwom bi mbuma.","BEHOLD, then, how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils."

58,7,6,"I mut nunu a bi lôl bé i lihaa li Lévi, ndi a bi yoñ jôga jada ikété jôm yak Abraham, a sayap ki nu a bi kôhna mimbônga.",but the man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
58,7,7,"Ibabé pééna, nunkeñi nyen a nsayap nuntitigi.","Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater."

58,8,2,"nyen a yé ngwélél nu homa mpubhaga ni nu bañga lap le Yéhôva nyen a bi oñ, ha mut binam bé.","a public servant of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah put up, and not man."
58,8,3,Inyule hiki prisi keñi i ntééba inyu ti makébla lôñni bisesema; jon i bé nseñ le yak nunu a bana ngim yom i ti.,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
58,8,4,"Ibale a bak hana ’isi, ki a ta bé prisi, inyule ngim bôt i yé le yon i nti bisesema inoñnaga ni mbén Môsi.","If, now, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being men who offer the gifts according to the Law,"
58,8,5,I bôt bana ba ngwel nson mpubhaga u u yé ndémbél ni titii i mam ma ngii; nlélém kiki Nyambe a bi ti Môsi oda ngéda a bé bebee ni oñ lap: Inyule a nkal le: “Yoñ yihe le u boñ mam momasôna inoñnaga ni ndémbél u bi tehe i hikôa.”,"but which men are rendering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to make the tent in completion, was given the divine command: For says he: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”"
58,8,6,"Ndi nano Yésu a bi kôhna bañga nson, inyule a yé ki ñat bañga malômba ma ma bi tééba inoñnaga ni mbén i ngii bañga mimbônga.","But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent public service, so that he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established upon better promises."
58,8,7,"Ibale malômbla ma bisu ma bana bé nsohi, ki ma nyônôs ima ma ta bé nseñ.","For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second;"
58,8,8,Inyule a yé toi i ôm litén nsohi ngéda a nkal le: “Yéhôva a nkal le: ‘Nuna-ki! Dilo di nlo le m’a boñ malômbla ma yondo ni ndap Israel lôñni ndap Yuda.,"for he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! There are days coming,’ says Jehovah, ‘and I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;"
58,8,9,"Ma ga ba bé kiki malômbla me bi boñ ni basôgôlsôgôl bap i kel me bi gwel bo woo inyu nyodna bo i loñ Égiptô; inyule ba bi téñbe bé ni malômbla mem, jon me bi waa tôñ bo,’ hala nyen Yéhôva a mpot.","not according to the covenant that I made with their forefathers in the day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.”"
58,9,1,"Ndi malômbla ma bisu ma bééna matéak inyu nson mpubhaga, ma ban-ga homa mpubhaga hana ’isi.","For its part, then, the former covenant used to have ordinances of sacred service and its mundane holy place."
58,9,10,"Bi yé ndik bijeje ni binyonyo, ni ngandak mintén mi manjel inyu pubus bôt ni inyu pubus gwom. Bi bé matéak inyu nyuu minsôn letee ntéak ngéda inyu kodol mam u kola.",but have to do only with foods and drinks and various baptisms. They were legal requirements pertaining to the flesh and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight.
58,9,11,"Ndi ngéda Kristô a bi lo kiki prisi keñi i mam malam ma ma bi mal lo, a bi jôp ikété lap i i yé bañga ni peles iloo lap bisu, i i ta bé ñoñok ni moo, hala wee i tane bé hana nkoñ ’isi.","However, when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come to pass, through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,"
58,9,12,"A bi jôp bé i homa mpubhaga ni matjél ma bibép bi kembee, to ni ma bon ba nyaga, ndi a bi jôp ni matjél mé nyemede ngélé yada inyu ngélé yosôna, a kuhul ki bés tohi i boga.","he entered, no, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time into the holy place and obtained an everlasting deliverance for us."
58,9,13,"Inyule ibale ba nwes matjél ma bibép bi kembee ni ma balôm ba nyaga, lôñni libu li ngond nyaga i ngii bôt ba bi hooba mahindi le ma pubus bo kayéle minsôn nwap mi ba mapubi,","For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies to the extent of cleanness of the flesh,"
58,9,14,"bôô ni ngélé yañen ni matjél ma Kristô, nu a bi ti nyemede yak Nyambe ngi liton li mahindi ni njel mbuu mpubi u boga? Ngo ma ga pubus kiññem yés inyu minson mi yé nwok kayéle di gwel nson mpubhaga inyu Nyambe nu a niñ.","how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God?"
58,9,15,"Inyu hala nyen a yé ñat malômbla ma yondo, inyu boñ le i bôt ba bi séblana ba kôhna mbônga u bum i boga. Hala kiki ni njel binoñ, nyemb yé i nkobol bo ni bibéba ba bi boñ isi malômbla ma bisu.","So that is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has occurred for their release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, the ones who have been called might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance."
58,9,16,"Inyule i homa malômbla ma yéne, i mbéda nyemb i mut nu a mboñ malômbla,","For where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be furnished."
58,9,17,"inyule malômbla ma gwééne ndik ngui i mbus nyemb, hala kiki ma gwé bé ngui ntel wonsôna i mut a mboñ malômbla a ngi yii i niñ.","For a covenant is valid over dead victims, since it is not in force at any time while the human covenanter is living."
58,9,18,Jon to malômbla ma bisu ma bé bé le ma bana ngui ibale matjél ma kuba bé.,Consequently neither was the former covenant inaugurated without blood.
58,9,19,"Inyule ngéda Môsi a bi mal kal litén biniigana bi Mbén gwobisôna, a yoñ matjél ma bon ba nyaga ni ma bibép bi kembee, lôñni malép, ni kôyôp libadô li mahuu ma ntômba, yak ni tjai di e hisôp, a nwes mo i ngii kaat malômbla ni i ngii litén jolisôna,","For when every commandment according to the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled the book itself and all the people,"
58,9,2,"Inyule tuñ bisu i lap i bi ôña, yon i bééna tééne lambe ni téblé, lôñni bret bi makébla; ba nsébél yo le Homa mpubhaga.",For there was constructed a first tent compartment in which were the lampstand and also the table and the display of the loaves; and it is called “the Holy Place.”
58,9,20,a kal le: “Mana mon ma yé matjél ma malômbla Nyambe a nti bé oda le ni tééda.”,saying: “This is the blood of the covenant that God has laid as a charge upon YOU.”
58,9,21,A bi nwes ki matjél i ngii lap ni i ngii biébél gwobisôna bi nson mpubhaga.,And he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the public service likewise with the blood.
58,9,22,"Ñ, inoñnaga ni mbén Môsi, matjél ma mpubus bebee le mam momasôna; handugi le matjél ma kuba, nwéhél i bibéba i nla bé ba.","Yes, nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place."
58,9,23,"Jon, hala a bé nseñ le dihéga di mam ma ngii di pubhana ni njel bisesema bini, ndi mam ma ngii momede ma mbat bañga bañga bisesema.","Therefore it was necessary that the typical representations of the things in the heavens should be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices that are better than such sacrifices."
58,9,24,"Inyule Kristô a bi jôp bé i homa mpubhaga nu a bi ôña ni moo, a bak pôna i bañga homa mpubhaga, ndi a bi jôp i ngii yomede, kayéle a telep i bisu bi Nyambe inyu yés.","For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us."
58,9,25,"A bi boñ bé hala inyu ti nyemede ngandak ngélé, kiki ngéda prisi keñi i bé jôp ikété homa mpubhaga hiki nwii lôñni matjél ma ma ta bé mé.","Neither is it in order that he should offer himself often, as indeed the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood not his own."
58,9,26,"Ibale hala, ki a bé lama le a nok ndutu ngandak ngélé ibôdôl i bibôdle bi nkoñ ’isi. Ndi nano, a bi nene ngélé yada inyu ngélé yosôna i mamélél ma nkoñ ’isi inyu héya béba ni njel i sem a bi sem nyemede.","Otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to put sin away through the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"Nlélém kiki bôt ba gwé le ba wo ngélé yada inyu ngélé yosôna, ndi i mbus hala ba kôhna mbagi;","And as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment,"
58,9,28,"hala nyen yak Kristô a bi ti nyemede ngélé yada inyu ngélé yosôna inyu begee bibéba bi ngandak bôt; ndi ngéda a’ nene inyu ngélé i nyônôs iba, a’ lo bé inyu héya bibéba, ndi i bôt ba nyégi i bem nye le a tohol bo, ba ga tehe nye.",so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin and to those earnestly looking for him for their salvation.
58,9,3,Ndi tuñ i lap ba nsébél le Homa a nlôôha mpubhaga i bé i mbus libadô li nyônôs iba.,But behind the second curtain was the tent compartment called “the Most Holy.”
58,9,4,"Mu nyen beglene binjinjiñ i gôl i bééne lôñni nkuu malômbla u u bé nhook ni gôl homa nyensôna, mukété nyen himbôga hi mana hi bééne, ni kék Arôn i i bi too, lôñni dibambha di ngok di malômbla;","This had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which were the golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"ndi yiye i bikérubim bi lipém i bé i ngii nkuu, i bé hô ngudul bikwak. Ndi ngéda bé ini nano le di toñol i mam mana momasôna.",but up above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory cover. But now is not the time to speak in detail concerning these things.
58,9,6,"I ngéda gwom bini bi mal ôña hala, biprisi bi njôp i tuñ bisu ngéda yosôna inyu gwel minson mimpubhaga;","After these things had been constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent compartment at all times to perform the sacred services;"
58,9,7,"ndi prisi keñi i njôp yotama ikété tuñ i nyônôs iba ngélé yada hiki nwii, a ban-ga matjél le a nti inyu yé nyemede ni inyu bibéba litén li mboñ inyu ngiyi.","but into the second compartment the high priest alone enters once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people."
58,9,8,Hala nyen mbuu mpubi u ntibil toi unda le njel i nkena i homa mpubhaga i bé ngi yeelana ntel wonsôna lap bisu i bé i ngi téé.,Thus the holy spirit makes it plain that the way into the holy place had not yet been made manifest while the first tent was standing.
58,9,9,"I lap ini i yé hihéga inyu ngéda i len; inoñnaga ni bitelbene bini, makébla lôñni bisesema bi ntiba. Ndi to hala, bi nla bé boñ le kiññem i mut a yé i gwel nson mpubhaga i yila peles.","This very tent is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here, and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the man doing sacred service perfect as respects his conscience,"
59,1,1,"Me Yakôbô, nkol u Nyambe ni u Nwet le Yésu Kristô, me ntilna jôm li matén ni ima, ma ma yé ntjamak bahoma bahoma: Me nyéga bé!","James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes that are scattered about: Greetings!"
59,1,10,"yak ngwañ mut u kon maséé le u nsuhlana, inyule w’a tagbe kiki mbônji bikai.","and the rich one over his humiliation, because like a flower of the vegetation he will pass away."
59,1,11,"Inyule kiki hiañgaa hi mpam ni ngandak lék, hi lighak bibebela, mbônji yap i kwok, yak bilama gwap bi malak, hala ki nyen ngwañ mut w’a nyoi mu nyiña wé nkus.","For the sun rises with its burning heat and withers the vegetation, and its flower drops off and the beauty of its outward appearance perishes. So, too, the rich man will fade away in his ways of life."
59,1,12,"Maséé ni i mut a ntéñbe i hônba manoodana, inyule ngéda a mal lémél Nyambe, a’ kôhna ntut u niñ Yéhôva a bi bôn i bôt ba tiñi i gwés Nye.","Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him."
59,1,13,"I ngéda manoodana, mut to wada a kal bañ le: “Nyambe nyen a noode me.” Inyule Nyambe a nla bé noodana ni mam mabe, to nyemede a noode bé mut hala.","When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone."
59,1,14,"Ndi hiki mut a nkôhna manoodana ngéda minheña nwé nyemede mi ñôt nye, mi lop ki nye.",But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.
59,1,15,"I ngéda minheña mi nhôlôl, mi ngwal béba; ndi ngéda béba i mbôña, i nlona nyemb.","Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death."
59,1,16,"A lôk kéé yem i gwéha, ni yôm bañ.","Do not be misled, my beloved brothers."
59,1,17,"Hiki likébla lilam ni hiki likébla li yé peles li nlôl i ngii, Yak isañ nu mapubi ma ngii, nu a nhéñha bé to heñla kiki yiye i i nyiñgha.","Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the celestial lights, and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow."
59,1,18,"Inyu sômbôl yé nyen a bi tine bés niñ ni njel bañga i maliga, kayéle di yila wengoñle matam ma bisu ikété bihégél gwé.","Because he willed it, he brought us forth by the word of truth, for us to be certain firstfruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"A lôk kéé yem i gwéha, yina le: Hiki mut a nlama ba mut a mpala emble, a tiñhaga pot, a bak mut nu a mpala bé unup,","Know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath;"
59,1,2,"A lôk kéé, ngéda ni mboma manoodana nya ndi nya, yoña hala ni maséé momasôna,","Consider it all joy, my brothers, when YOU meet with various trials,"
59,1,20,inyule hiun hi mut binam hi nlona bé telepsép i Nyambe.,for man’s wrath does not work out God’s righteousness.
59,1,21,"Jon héyana mahindi momasôna, lôñni hiki liton li béba, ni neebe ki ni ñemlima le bañga i béla ikété nan, yon i nla tohol bé.","Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save YOUR souls."
59,1,22,"Ndi yilnana banôgôl bañga, ha ndik baemble bé, tiga le ni lôk bébomede ni bipék bibe.","However, become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning."
59,1,23,"Inyule ibale mut a yé ndik nu a ñemble bañga, ndi a ba bé nu a nôgôl yo, a yé wengoñle mut nu a mbéñge su wé nyemede i léman.","For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror."
59,1,24,"Inyule a mbéñgba, a ke, a pala ki hôya umbe ntén mut a yé.","For he looks at himself, and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is."
59,1,25,"Ndi nu a mbok mis ikété mbén i i yé peles, i i nlona kunde, a téñbe ki mu, a ta bé mut a ñemble ndi a hôya, ndi a yé mut a ngwel nson; a ga kon ki maséé mu mam a mboñ.","But he who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in it, this man, because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, will be happy in his doing it."
59,1,26,"Ibale mut a nhoñol le a mbégés Nyambe, ndi a tibil bé gwel hilémb hié, wee a nlôk ñem wé nyemede, yak bibégés gwé bi yé yañga.","If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this man’s form of worship is futile."
59,1,27,"Ntén bibégés u u yé mpubi, u u gwé bé to mahindi i litehge li Nyambe ni Tata wés, wo unu le: I tééda bon ba nyuu ni biyik bi bôda ikété njiiha yap, ni le mut a tat nyemede le a hooba bañ to liton li mahindi ma nkoñ ’isi.","The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world."
59,1,3,"hala kiki ni nyi le ngéda hémle nan i nkôhna manoodana, hala a nti hônba.",knowing as YOU do that this tested quality of YOUR faith works out endurance.
59,1,4,"Ndi hônba i nlama mélés nson wé le ndi ni ba nyonok, ni boñok mam momasôna loñge, kayéle jam to jada li héñél bañ bé.","But let endurance have its work complete, that YOU may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything."
59,1,5,"Jon ibale mut ikété nan a nhañ pék, a ke ni bisu i bat yo Nyambe, inyule a nkébél bôt bobasôna i nya i nloo hihéga ibabé i yahal bo, ha nyen a’ kôhna yo.","So, if any one of YOU is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching; and it will be given him."
59,1,6,"Ndi a téñbe i bat ni hémle, ngi pééna yo ki yo, inyule i mut a mpééna a yé kiki nnoñgo tuye le mbebi i nyuge, i ndéñghak ki to hee to hee.","But let him keep on asking in faith, not doubting at all, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about."
59,1,7,"Ni maliga, i mut nu a bem bañ le a’ kôhna jam jo ki jo yak Yéhôva;","In fact, let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from Jehovah;"
59,1,8,"A yé mut miñem ima, a ndeñg ikété manjel mé momasôna.","he is an indecisive man, unsteady in all his ways."
59,1,9,"Ndi mankéé nu a yé hiyeyeba hi mut a kon maséé le a mbédhana,","But let the lowly brother exult over his exaltation,"
59,2,1,"A lôk kéé yem, lelaa ni nla téñbe ni hémle i Nwet wés nu lipém le Yésu Kristô ngéda ni ntodol bôt?","My brothers, YOU are not holding the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, our glory, with acts of favoritism, are YOU?"
59,2,10,"Inyule ibale mut a nôgôl mbén Môsi yosôna ndi a baage inyu to litode jada mu, wee a mbôk mbén yosôna.","For whoever observes all the Law but makes a false step in one point, he has become an offender against them all."
59,2,11,"Inyule nu a bi kal le: “U nlama bé ke i ndéñg,” nyen a bi kal ki le: “U nlama bé nol mut.” Ndi ibale u nke bé ndéñg ndi u nol mut, wee u mbôk mbén.","For he who said: “You must not commit adultery,” said also: “You must not murder.” If, now, you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of law."
59,2,12,Kena ni bisu i pot ni niñ kiki bôt le ba nlama kéés lôñni mbén i ñéga bôt ba yé kunde.,Keep on speaking in such a way and keep on doing in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people.
59,2,13,"Inyule i mut a gwé bé lem i bana konangoo, yak nye a’ bana bikééhene ngi konangoo. Konangoo i nyémbél bikééhene.",For the one that does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy. Mercy exults triumphantly over judgment.
59,2,14,"A lôk kéé yem, umbe nseñ mut a gwé ibale a nkal le a gwé hémle ndi a bana bé minson? I hémle ini i nla bé tohol nye, hala bé?","Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if a certain one says he has faith but he does not have works? That faith cannot save him, can it?"
59,2,15,"Ibale bilôk bikéé bi bôlôm to bi bôda bi gwé bé mambot to bijek bi kôli inyu ngim kel,","If a brother or a sister is in a naked state and lacking the food sufficient for the day,"

59,2,17,Jon yak hémle yotama ngi minson i yé nwok.,"Thus, too, faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself."
59,2,18,"Ndi mut a’ kal le: “We u gwé hémle, me me gwé minson.

Show me your faith apart from the works, and I shall show you my faith by my works.”"
59,2,19,"U nhémle le Nyambe a yé ndik wada, u mboñ yaga loñge. Ngo yak mimbuu mimbe mi nhémle, mi sehlaga ni woñi.","You believe there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder."

61,1,17,"Inyule Nyambe Tata a bi ti nye lipém ni bibégés ngéda a bi nok bibañga bini ni njel lipém likeñi le: “Man wem nunu, Man wem nu gwéha, nyen a nlémél me.”","For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when words such as these were borne to him by the magnificent glory: “This is my son, my beloved, whom I myself have approved.”"

61,1,9,"Inyule i mut a gwé bé i mam mana, wee a yé ndim, a nyip mis le a tehe bañ mapubi, a nhôya ki le a bi pubhana ni bibéba gwé bi kôba.","For if these things are not present in anyone, he is blind, shutting his eyes to the light, and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago."
61,2,1,"Ndi yak bapôdôl ba bitembee ba bé ikété litén, hala ki nyen baniiga ba bitembee b’a ba ikété nan.

These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves."

61,2,21,"I bak nseñ inyu yap le ba bana bañ bañga yi i njel telepsép, iloole ngéda ba mal yi yo, ba témb ba kôm mbén pubi ba bi kôhna mbus.",For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.

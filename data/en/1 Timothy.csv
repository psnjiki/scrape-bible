1 Timothy	54	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus under command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope,
1 Timothy	54	1	2	to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith: May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Timothy	54	1	3	Just as I encouraged you to stay in Ephesus when I was about to go my way into Macedonia, so I do now, that you might command certain ones not to teach different doctrine,
1 Timothy	54	1	4	nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies, which end up in nothing, but which furnish questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith.
1 Timothy	54	1	5	Really the objective of this mandate is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.
1 Timothy	54	1	6	By deviating from these things certain ones have been turned aside into idle talk,
1 Timothy	54	1	7	wanting to be teachers of law, but not perceiving either the things they are saying or the things about which they are making strong assertions.
1 Timothy	54	1	8	Now we know that the Law is fine provided one handles it lawfully
1 Timothy	54	1	9	in the knowledge of this fact, that law is promulgated, not for a righteous man, but for persons lawless and unruly, ungodly and sinners, lacking loving-kindness, and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,
1 Timothy	54	1	10	fornicators, men who lie with males, kidnappers, liars, false swearers, and whatever other thing is in opposition to the healthful teaching
1 Timothy	54	1	11	according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.
1 Timothy	54	1	12	I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry,
1 Timothy	54	1	13	although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy, because I was ignorant and acted with a lack of faith.
1 Timothy	54	1	14	But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy	54	1	15	Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is the saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these I am foremost.
1 Timothy	54	1	16	Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long-suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.
1 Timothy	54	1	17	Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
1 Timothy	54	1	18	This mandate I commit to you, child, Timothy, in accord with the predictions that led directly on to you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare;
1 Timothy	54	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside and have experienced shipwreck concerning their faith.
1 Timothy	54	1	20	Hymenaeus and Alexander belong to these, and I have handed them over to Satan that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme.

1 Timothy	54	2	1	I therefore exhort, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, offerings of thanks, be made concerning all sorts of men,
1 Timothy	54	2	2	concerning kings and all those who are in high station; in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.
1 Timothy	54	2	3	This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,
1 Timothy	54	2	4	whose will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
1 Timothy	54	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy	54	2	6	who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to at its own particular times.
1 Timothy	54	2	7	For the purpose of this witness I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth.
1 Timothy	54	2	8	Therefore I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands, apart from wrath and debates.
1 Timothy	54	2	9	Likewise I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb,
1 Timothy	54	2	10	but in the way that befits women professing to reverence God, namely, through good works.
1 Timothy	54	2	11	Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness.
1 Timothy	54	2	12	I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.
1 Timothy	54	2	13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
1 Timothy	54	2	14	Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and came to be in transgression.
1 Timothy	54	2	15	However, she will be kept safe through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and sanctification along with soundness of mind.

1 Timothy	54	3	1	That statement is faithful. If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.
1 Timothy	54	3	2	The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach,
1 Timothy	54	3	3	not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, but reasonable, not belligerent, not a lover of money,
1 Timothy	54	3	4	a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness;
1 Timothy	54	3	5	(if indeed any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God’s congregation?)
1 Timothy	54	3	6	not a newly converted man, for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil.
1 Timothy	54	3	7	Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony from people on the outside, in order that he might not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil.
1 Timothy	54	3	8	Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued, not giving themselves to a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain,
1 Timothy	54	3	9	holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.
1 Timothy	54	3	10	Also, let these be tested as to fitness first, then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.
1 Timothy	54	3	11	Women should likewise be serious, not slanderous, moderate in habits, faithful in all things.
1 Timothy	54	3	12	Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over children and their own households.
1 Timothy	54	3	13	For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy	54	3	14	I am writing you these things, though I am hoping to come to you shortly,
1 Timothy	54	3	15	but in case I am delayed, that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.
1 Timothy	54	3	16	Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in the world, was received up in glory.’

1 Timothy	54	4	1	However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons,
1 Timothy	54	4	2	by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron;
1 Timothy	54	4	3	forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.
1 Timothy	54	4	4	The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
1 Timothy	54	4	5	for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over it.
1 Timothy	54	4	6	By giving these advices to the brothers you will be a fine minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching which you have followed closely.
1 Timothy	54	4	7	But turn down the false stories which violate what is holy and which old women tell. On the other hand, be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim.
1 Timothy	54	4	8	For bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.
1 Timothy	54	4	9	Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is that statement.
1 Timothy	54	4	10	For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.
1 Timothy	54	4	11	Keep on giving these commands and teaching them.
1 Timothy	54	4	12	Let no man ever look down on your youth. On the contrary, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.
1 Timothy	54	4	13	While I am coming, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
1 Timothy	54	4	14	Do not be neglecting the gift in you that was given you through a prediction and when the body of older men laid their hands upon you.
1 Timothy	54	4	15	Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.
1 Timothy	54	4	16	Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

1 Timothy	54	5	1	Do not severely criticize an older man. To the contrary, entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers,
1 Timothy	54	5	2	older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.
1 Timothy	54	5	3	Honor widows that are actually widows.
1 Timothy	54	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household and to keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents, for this is acceptable in God’s sight.
1 Timothy	54	5	5	Now the woman who is actually a widow and left destitute has put her hope in God and persists in supplications and prayers night and day.
1 Timothy	54	5	6	But the one that goes in for sensual gratification is dead though she is living.
1 Timothy	54	5	7	So keep on giving these commands, that they may be irreprehensible.
1 Timothy	54	5	8	Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.
1 Timothy	54	5	9	Let a widow be put on the list who has become not less than sixty years old, a wife of one husband,
1 Timothy	54	5	10	having a witness borne to her for fine works, if she reared children, if she entertained strangers, if she washed the feet of holy ones, if she relieved those in tribulation, if she diligently followed every good work.
1 Timothy	54	5	11	On the other hand, turn down younger widows, for when their sexual impulses have come between them and the Christ, they want to marry,
1 Timothy	54	5	12	having a judgment because they have disregarded their first expression of faith.
1 Timothy	54	5	13	At the same time they also learn to be unoccupied, gadding about to the houses; yes, not only unoccupied, but also gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs, talking of things they ought not.
1 Timothy	54	5	14	Therefore I desire the younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give no inducement to the opposer to revile.
1 Timothy	54	5	15	Already, in fact, some have been turned aside to follow Satan.
1 Timothy	54	5	16	If any believing woman has widows, let her relieve them, and let the congregation not be under the burden. Then it can relieve those who are actually widows.
1 Timothy	54	5	17	Let the older men who preside in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.
1 Timothy	54	5	18	For the scripture says: “You must not muzzle a bull when it threshes out the grain”; also: “The workman is worthy of his wages.”
1 Timothy	54	5	19	Do not admit an accusation against an older man, except only on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy	54	5	20	Reprove before all onlookers persons who practice sin, that the rest also may have fear.
1 Timothy	54	5	21	I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to keep these things without prejudgment, doing nothing according to a biased leaning.
1 Timothy	54	5	22	Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.
1 Timothy	54	5	23	Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.
1 Timothy	54	5	24	The sins of some men are publicly manifest, leading directly to judgment, but as for other men their sins also become manifest later.
1 Timothy	54	5	25	In the same way also the fine works are publicly manifest and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hid.

1 Timothy	54	6	1	Let as many as are slaves under a yoke keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor, that the name of God and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously.
1 Timothy	54	6	2	Moreover, let those having believing owners not look down on them, because they are brothers. On the contrary, let them the more readily be slaves, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved. Keep on teaching these things and giving these exhortations.
1 Timothy	54	6	3	If any man teaches other doctrine and does not assent to healthful words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor to the teaching that accords with godly devotion,
1 Timothy	54	6	4	he is puffed up with pride, not understanding anything, but being mentally diseased over questionings and debates about words. From these things spring envy, strife, abusive speeches, wicked suspicions,
1 Timothy	54	6	5	violent disputes about trifles on the part of men corrupted in mind and despoiled of the truth, thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain.
1 Timothy	54	6	6	To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency.
1 Timothy	54	6	7	For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out.
1 Timothy	54	6	8	So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.
1 Timothy	54	6	9	However, those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.
1 Timothy	54	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.
1 Timothy	54	6	11	However, you, O man of God, flee from these things. But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper.
1 Timothy	54	6	12	Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.
1 Timothy	54	6	13	In the sight of God, who preserves all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who as a witness made the fine public declaration before Pontius Pilate, I give you orders
1 Timothy	54	6	14	that you observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Timothy	54	6	15	This manifestation the happy and only Potentate will show in its own appointed times, he the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,
1 Timothy	54	6	16	the one alone having immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom not one of men has seen or can see. To him be honor and might everlasting. Amen.
1 Timothy	54	6	17	Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high-minded, and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment;
1 Timothy	54	6	18	to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share,
1 Timothy	54	6	19	safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life.
1 Timothy	54	6	20	O Timothy, guard what is laid up in trust with you, turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called “knowledge.”
1 Timothy	54	6	21	For making a show of such knowledge some have deviated from the faith. May the undeserved kindness be with YOU people.

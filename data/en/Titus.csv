Titus	56	1	1	Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the accurate knowledge of the truth which accords with godly devotion
Titus	56	1	2	upon the basis of a hope of the everlasting life which God, who cannot lie, promised before times long lasting,
Titus	56	1	3	whereas in his own due times he made his word manifest in the preaching with which I was entrusted, under command of our Savior, God;
Titus	56	1	4	to Titus, a genuine child according to a faith shared in common: May there be undeserved kindness and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus	56	1	5	For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might correct the things that were defective and might make appointments of older men in city after city, as I gave you orders;
Titus	56	1	6	if there is any man free from accusation, a husband of one wife, having believing children that were not under a charge of debauchery nor unruly.
Titus	56	1	7	For an overseer must be free from accusation as God’s steward, not self-willed, not prone to wrath, not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, not greedy of dishonest gain,
Titus	56	1	8	but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sound in mind, righteous, loyal, self-controlled,
Titus	56	1	9	holding firmly to the faithful word as respects his art of teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the teaching that is healthful and to reprove those who contradict.
Titus	56	1	10	For there are many unruly men, profitless talkers, and deceivers of the mind, especially those men who adhere to the circumcision.
Titus	56	1	11	It is necessary to shut the mouths of these, as these very men keep on subverting entire households by teaching things they ought not for the sake of dishonest gain.
Titus	56	1	12	A certain one of them, their own prophet, said: “Cretans are always liars, injurious wild beasts, unemployed gluttons.”
Titus	56	1	13	This witness is true. For this very cause keep on reproving them with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith,
Titus	56	1	14	paying no attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn themselves away from the truth.
Titus	56	1	15	All things are clean to clean persons. But to persons defiled and faithless nothing is clean, but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
Titus	56	1	16	They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works, because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort.

Titus	56	2	1	You, however, keep on speaking what things are fitting for healthful teaching.
Titus	56	2	2	Let the aged men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance.
Titus	56	2	3	Likewise let the aged women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, neither enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good;
Titus	56	2	4	that they may recall the young women to their senses to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus	56	2	5	to be sound in mind, chaste, workers at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.
Titus	56	2	6	Likewise keep on exhorting the younger men to be sound in mind,
Titus	56	2	7	in all things showing yourself an example of fine works; showing uncorruptness in your teaching, seriousness,
Titus	56	2	8	wholesome speech which cannot be condemned; so that the man on the opposing side may get ashamed, having nothing vile to say about us.
Titus	56	2	9	Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things, and please them well, not talking back,
Titus	56	2	10	not committing theft, but exhibiting good fidelity to the full, so that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.
Titus	56	2	11	For the undeserved kindness of God which brings salvation to all sorts of men has been manifested,
Titus	56	2	12	instructing us to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things,
Titus	56	2	13	while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of the Savior of us, Christ Jesus,
Titus	56	2	14	who gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works.
Titus	56	2	15	Keep on speaking these things and exhorting and reproving with full authority to command. Let no man ever despise you.

Titus	56	3	1	Continue reminding them to be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities as rulers, to be ready for every good work,
Titus	56	3	2	to speak injuriously of no one, not to be belligerent, to be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men.
Titus	56	3	3	For even we were once senseless, disobedient, being misled, being slaves to various desires and pleasures, carrying on in badness and envy, abhorrent, hating one another.
Titus	56	3	4	However, when the kindness and the love for man on the part of our Savior, God, was manifested,
Titus	56	3	5	owing to no works in righteousness that we had performed, but according to his mercy he saved us through the bath that brought us to life and through the making of us new by holy spirit.
Titus	56	3	6	This spirit he poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus	56	3	7	that, after being declared righteous by virtue of the undeserved kindness of that one, we might become heirs according to a hope of everlasting life.
Titus	56	3	8	Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire you to make firm assertions constantly, in order that those who have believed God may keep their minds on maintaining fine works. These things are fine and beneficial to men.
Titus	56	3	9	But shun foolish questionings and genealogies and strife and fights over the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile.
Titus	56	3	10	As for a man that promotes a sect, reject him after a first and a second admonition;
Titus	56	3	11	knowing that such a man has been turned out of the way and is sinning, he being self-condemned.
Titus	56	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your utmost to come to me at Nicopolis, for there is where I have decided to winter.
Titus	56	3	13	Carefully supply Zenas, who is versed in the Law, and Apollos for their trip, that they may not lack anything.
Titus	56	3	14	But let our people also learn to maintain fine works so as to meet their pressing needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
Titus	56	3	15	All those with me send you their greetings. Give my greetings to those who have affection for us in the faith. May the undeserved kindness be with all of YOU people.

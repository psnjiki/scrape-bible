2 Timothy	55	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will according to the promise of the life that is in union with Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy	55	1	2	to Timothy, a beloved child: May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy	55	1	3	I am grateful to God, to whom I am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did and with a clean conscience, that I never leave off remembering you in my supplications, night and day
2 Timothy	55	1	4	longing to see you, as I remember your tears, that I may get filled with joy.
2 Timothy	55	1	5	For I recollect the faith which is in you without any hypocrisy, and which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, but which I am confident is also in you.
2 Timothy	55	1	6	For this very cause I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you through the laying of my hands upon you.
2 Timothy	55	1	7	For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.
2 Timothy	55	1	8	Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord, neither of me a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God.
2 Timothy	55	1	9	He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not by reason of our works, but by reason of his own purpose and undeserved kindness. This was given us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long lasting,
2 Timothy	55	1	10	but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death but has shed light upon life and incorruption through the good news,
2 Timothy	55	1	11	for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher.
2 Timothy	55	1	12	For this very cause I am also suffering these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the one whom I have believed, and I am confident he is able to guard what I have laid up in trust with him until that day.
2 Timothy	55	1	13	Keep holding the pattern of healthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy	55	1	14	This fine trust guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us.
2 Timothy	55	1	15	You know this, that all the men in the district of Asia have turned away from me. Phygelus and Hermogenes are of that number.
2 Timothy	55	1	16	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often brought me refreshment, and he did not become ashamed of my chains.
2 Timothy	55	1	17	On the contrary, when he happened to be in Rome, he diligently looked for me and found me.
2 Timothy	55	1	18	May the Lord grant him to find mercy from Jehovah in that day. And all the services he rendered in Ephesus you know well enough.

2 Timothy	55	2	1	You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in connection with Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy	55	2	2	and the things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.
2 Timothy	55	2	3	As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus take your part in suffering evil.
2 Timothy	55	2	4	No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order that he may gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.
2 Timothy	55	2	5	Moreover, if anyone contends even in the games, he is not crowned unless he has contended according to the rules.
2 Timothy	55	2	6	The hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits.
2 Timothy	55	2	7	Give constant thought to what I am saying; the Lord will really give you discernment in all things.
2 Timothy	55	2	8	Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead and was of David’s seed, according to the good news I preach;
2 Timothy	55	2	9	in connection with which I am suffering evil to the point of prison bonds as an evildoer. Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.
2 Timothy	55	2	10	On this account I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in union with Christ Jesus along with everlasting glory.
2 Timothy	55	2	11	Faithful is the saying: Certainly if we died together, we shall also live together;
2 Timothy	55	2	12	if we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings; if we deny, he also will deny us;
2 Timothy	55	2	13	if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy	55	2	14	Keep reminding them of these things, charging them before God as witness, not to fight about words, a thing of no usefulness at all because it overturns those listening.
2 Timothy	55	2	15	Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.
2 Timothy	55	2	16	But shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness,
2 Timothy	55	2	17	and their word will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of that number.
2 Timothy	55	2	18	These very men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.
2 Timothy	55	2	19	For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal: “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and: “Let everyone naming the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.”
2 Timothy	55	2	20	Now in a large house there are vessels not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable purpose but others for a purpose lacking honor.
2 Timothy	55	2	21	If, therefore, anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be a vessel for an honorable purpose, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work.
2 Timothy	55	2	22	So, flee from the desires incidental to youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.
2 Timothy	55	2	23	Further, turn down foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing they produce fights.
2 Timothy	55	2	24	But a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, keeping himself restrained under evil,
2 Timothy	55	2	25	instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed; as perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth,
2 Timothy	55	2	26	and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him for the will of that one.

2 Timothy	55	3	1	But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.
2 Timothy	55	3	2	For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,
2 Timothy	55	3	3	having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,
2 Timothy	55	3	4	betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God,
2 Timothy	55	3	5	having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.
2 Timothy	55	3	6	For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,
2 Timothy	55	3	7	always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
2 Timothy	55	3	8	Now in the way that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also go on resisting the truth, men completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith.
2 Timothy	55	3	9	Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their madness will be very plain to all, even as the madness of those two men became.
2 Timothy	55	3	10	But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my long-suffering, my love, my endurance,
2 Timothy	55	3	11	my persecutions, my sufferings, the sort of things that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, the sort of persecutions I have borne; and yet out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy	55	3	12	In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.
2 Timothy	55	3	13	But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.
2 Timothy	55	3	14	You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them
2 Timothy	55	3	15	and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy	55	3	16	All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,
2 Timothy	55	3	17	that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.

2 Timothy	55	4	1	I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is destined to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his kingdom,
2 Timothy	55	4	2	preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long-suffering and art of teaching.
2 Timothy	55	4	3	For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled;
2 Timothy	55	4	4	and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories.
2 Timothy	55	4	5	You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.
2 Timothy	55	4	6	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the due time for my releasing is imminent.
2 Timothy	55	4	7	I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.
2 Timothy	55	4	8	From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not only to me, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.
2 Timothy	55	4	9	Do your utmost to come to me shortly.
2 Timothy	55	4	10	For Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy	55	4	11	Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.
2 Timothy	55	4	12	But I have sent Tychicus off to Ephesus.
2 Timothy	55	4	13	When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.
2 Timothy	55	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me many injuries—Jehovah will repay him according to his deeds—
2 Timothy	55	4	15	and you too be on guard against him, for he resisted our words to an excessive degree.
2 Timothy	55	4	16	In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all proceeded to forsake me—may it not be put to their account—
2 Timothy	55	4	17	but the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; and I was delivered from the lion’s mouth.
2 Timothy	55	4	18	The Lord will deliver me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy	55	4	19	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy	55	4	20	Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
2 Timothy	55	4	21	Do your utmost to arrive before winter. Eubulus sends you his greetings, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.
2 Timothy	55	4	22	The Lord be with the spirit you show. His undeserved kindness be with YOU people.

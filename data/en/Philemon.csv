Philemon	57	1	1	Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother, to Philemon, our beloved one and fellow worker,
Philemon	57	1	2	and to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:
Philemon	57	1	3	May YOU people have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon	57	1	4	I always thank my God when I make mention of you in my prayers,
Philemon	57	1	5	as I keep hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy ones;
Philemon	57	1	6	in order that the sharing of your faith may go into action by your acknowledging of every good thing among us as related to Christ.
Philemon	57	1	7	For I got much joy and comfort over your love, because the tender affections of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.
Philemon	57	1	8	For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,
Philemon	57	1	9	I am exhorting you rather on the basis of love, seeing that I am such as I am, Paul an aged man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;
Philemon	57	1	10	I am exhorting you concerning my child, to whom I became a father while in my prison bonds, Onesimus,
Philemon	57	1	11	formerly useless to you but now useful to you and to me.
Philemon	57	1	12	This very one I am sending back to you, yes, him, that is, my own tender affections.
Philemon	57	1	13	I would like to hold him back for myself that in place of you he might keep on ministering to me in the prison bonds I bear for the sake of the good news.
Philemon	57	1	14	But without your consent I do not want to do anything, so that your good act may be, not as under compulsion, but of your own free will.
Philemon	57	1	15	Perhaps really on this account he broke away for an hour, that you may have him back forever,
Philemon	57	1	16	no longer as a slave but as more than a slave, as a brother beloved, especially so to me, yet how much more so to you both in fleshly relationship and in the Lord.
Philemon	57	1	17	If, therefore, you consider me a sharer, receive him kindly the way you would me.
Philemon	57	1	18	Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, keep this charged to my account.
Philemon	57	1	19	I Paul am writing with my own hand: I will pay it backâ€”not to be telling you that, besides, you owe me even yourself.
Philemon	57	1	20	Yes, brother, may I derive profit from you in connection with the Lord: refresh my tender affections in connection with Christ.
Philemon	57	1	21	Trusting in your compliance, I am writing you, knowing you will even do more than the things I say.
Philemon	57	1	22	But along with that, also get lodging ready for me, for I am hoping that through the prayers of YOU people I shall be set at liberty for YOU.
Philemon	57	1	23	Sending you greetings is Epaphras my fellow captive in union with Christ,
Philemon	57	1	24	also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon	57	1	25	The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit YOU people show.

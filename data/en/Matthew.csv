Matthew	40	1	5	Salmon became father to Boaz by Rahab;Boaz became father to Obed by Ruth;Obed became father to Jesse;
Matthew	40	1	6	Jesse became father to David the king. David became father to Solomon by the wife of Uriah;
Matthew	40	1	7	Solomon became father to Rehoboam;Rehoboam became father to Abijah;Abijah became father to Asa;
Matthew	40	1	8	Asa became father to Jehoshaphat;Jehoshaphat became father to Jehoram;Jehoram became father to Uzziah;
Matthew	40	1	9	Uzziah became father to Jotham;Jotham became father to Ahaz;Ahaz became father to Hezekiah;
Matthew	40	1	10	Hezekiah became father to Manasseh;Manasseh became father to Amon;Amon became father to Josiah;
Matthew	40	1	11	Josiah became father to Jeconiah and to his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.

Matthew	40	1	13	Zerubbabel became father to Abiud;Abiud became father to Eliakim;Eliakim became father to Azor;

Matthew	40	1	16	Jacob became father to Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
Matthew	40	1	17	All the generations, then, from Abraham until David were fourteen generations, and from David until the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ fourteen generations.
Matthew	40	1	18	But the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way. During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united.
Matthew	40	1	19	However, Joseph her husband, because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, intended to divorce her secretly.
Matthew	40	1	20	But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home, for that which has been begotten in her is by holy spirit.
Matthew	40	1	21	She will give birth to a son, and you must call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
Matthew	40	1	22	All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying:
Matthew	40	1	23	“Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Immanuel,” which means, when translated, “With Us Is God.”
Matthew	40	1	24	Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him, and he took his wife home.
Matthew	40	1	25	But he had no intercourse with her until she gave birth to a son; and he called his name Jesus.

Matthew	40	2	1	After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from eastern parts came to Jerusalem,
Matthew	40	2	2	saying: “Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when we were in the east, and we have come to do him obeisance.”
Matthew	40	2	3	At hearing this King Herod was agitated, and all Jerusalem along with him;
Matthew	40	2	4	and on gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.
Matthew	40	2	5	They said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is how it has been written through the prophet,
Matthew	40	2	6	‘And you, O Bethlehem of the land of Judah, are by no means the most insignificant city among the governors of Judah; for out of you will come forth a governing one, who will shepherd my people, Israel.’”
Matthew	40	2	7	Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearing;
Matthew	40	2	8	and, when sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go make a careful search for the young child, and when YOU have found it report back to me, that I too may go and do it obeisance.”
Matthew	40	2	9	When they had heard the king, they went their way; and, look! the star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them, until it came to a stop above where the young child was.
Matthew	40	2	10	On seeing the star they rejoiced very much indeed.
Matthew	40	2	11	And when they went into the house they saw the young child with Mary its mother, and, falling down, they did obeisance to it. They also opened their treasures and presented it with gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew	40	2	12	However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another way.
Matthew	40	2	13	After they had withdrawn, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I give you word; for Herod is about to search for the young child to destroy it.”
Matthew	40	2	14	So he got up and took along the young child and its mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,
Matthew	40	2	15	and he stayed there until the decease of Herod, for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
Matthew	40	2	16	Then Herod, seeing he had been outwitted by the astrologers, fell into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts done away with, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers.
Matthew	40	2	17	Then that was fulfilled which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
Matthew	40	2	18	“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and much wailing; it was Rachel weeping for her children, and she was unwilling to take comfort, because they are no more.”
Matthew	40	2	19	When Herod had deceased, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
Matthew	40	2	20	and said: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and be on your way into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the soul of the young child are dead.”
Matthew	40	2	21	So he got up and took the young child and its mother and entered into the land of Israel.
Matthew	40	2	22	But hearing that Archelaus ruled as king of Judea instead of his father Herod, he became afraid to depart for there. Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew into the territory of Galilee,
Matthew	40	2	23	and came and dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”

Matthew	40	3	1	In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
Matthew	40	3	2	saying: “REPENT, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
Matthew	40	3	3	This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, YOU people! Make his roads straight.’”
Matthew	40	3	4	But this very John had his clothing of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins; his food too was insect locusts and wild honey.
Matthew	40	3	5	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan made their way out to him,
Matthew	40	3	6	and people were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.
Matthew	40	3	7	When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: “YOU offspring of vipers, who has intimated to YOU to flee from the coming wrath?
Matthew	40	3	8	So then produce fruit that befits repentance;
Matthew	40	3	9	and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to YOU that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
Matthew	40	3	10	Already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew	40	3	11	I, for my part, baptize YOU with water because of YOUR repentance; but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not fit to take off. That one will baptize YOU people with holy spirit and with fire.
Matthew	40	3	12	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will completely clean up his threshing floor, and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”
Matthew	40	3	13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized by him.
Matthew	40	3	14	But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”
Matthew	40	3	15	In reply Jesus said to him: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him.
Matthew	40	3	16	After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him.
Matthew	40	3	17	Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”

Matthew	40	4	1	Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.
Matthew	40	4	2	After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.
Matthew	40	4	3	Also, the Tempter came and said to him: “If you are a son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”
Matthew	40	4	4	But in reply he said: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’”
Matthew	40	4	5	Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him upon the battlement of the temple
Matthew	40	4	6	and said to him: “If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will give his angels a charge concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone.’”
Matthew	40	4	7	Jesus said to him: “Again it is written, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’”
Matthew	40	4	8	Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
Matthew	40	4	9	and he said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.”
Matthew	40	4	10	Then Jesus said to him: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”
Matthew	40	4	11	Then the Devil left him, and, look! angels came and began to minister to him.
Matthew	40	4	12	Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
Matthew	40	4	13	Further, after leaving Nazareth, he came and took up residence in Capernaum beside the sea in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali,
Matthew	40	4	14	that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:
Matthew	40	4	15	“O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
Matthew	40	4	16	the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.”
Matthew	40	4	17	From that time on Jesus commenced preaching and saying: “Repent, YOU people, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
Matthew	40	4	18	Walking alongside the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, letting down a fishing net into the sea, for they were fishers.
Matthew	40	4	19	And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make YOU fishers of men.”
Matthew	40	4	20	At once abandoning the nets, they followed him.
Matthew	40	4	21	Going on also from there he saw two others who were brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.
Matthew	40	4	22	At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.
Matthew	40	4	23	Then he went around throughout the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.
Matthew	40	4	24	And the report about him went out into all Syria; and they brought him all those faring badly, distressed with various diseases and torments, demon-possessed and epileptic and paralyzed persons, and he cured them.
Matthew	40	4	25	Consequently great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan.

Matthew	40	5	1	When he saw the crowds he went up into the mountain; and after he sat down his disciples came to him;
Matthew	40	5	2	and he opened his mouth and began teaching them, saying:
Matthew	40	5	3	“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
Matthew	40	5	4	“Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.
Matthew	40	5	5	“Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.
Matthew	40	5	6	“Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.
Matthew	40	5	7	“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.
Matthew	40	5	8	“Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.
Matthew	40	5	9	“Happy are the peaceable, since they will be called ‘sons of God.’
Matthew	40	5	10	“Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
Matthew	40	5	11	“Happy are YOU when people reproach YOU and persecute YOU and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against YOU for my sake.
Matthew	40	5	12	Rejoice and leap for joy, since YOUR reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to YOU.
Matthew	40	5	13	“YOU are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.
Matthew	40	5	14	“YOU are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain.
Matthew	40	5	15	People light a lamp and set it, not under the measuring basket, but upon the lampstand, and it shines upon all those in the house.
Matthew	40	5	16	Likewise let YOUR light shine before men, that they may see YOUR fine works and give glory to YOUR Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew	40	5	17	“Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill;
Matthew	40	5	18	for truly I say to YOU that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.
Matthew	40	5	19	Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches mankind to that effect, he will be called ‘least’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. As for anyone who does them and teaches them, this one will be called ‘great’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew	40	5	20	For I say to YOU that if YOUR righteousness does not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, YOU will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew	40	5	21	“YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder; but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’
Matthew	40	5	22	However, I say to YOU that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Gehenna.
Matthew	40	5	23	“If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you,
Matthew	40	5	24	leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.
Matthew	40	5	25	“Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law, while you are with him on the way there, that somehow the complainant may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.
Matthew	40	5	26	I say to you for a fact, You will certainly not come out from there until you have paid over the last coin of very little value.
Matthew	40	5	27	“YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’
Matthew	40	5	28	But I say to YOU that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew	40	5	29	If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost to you than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna.
Matthew	40	5	30	Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Gehenna.
Matthew	40	5	31	“Moreover it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’
Matthew	40	5	32	However, I say to YOU that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Matthew	40	5	33	“Again YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’
Matthew	40	5	34	However, I say to YOU: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God’s throne;
Matthew	40	5	35	nor by earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
Matthew	40	5	36	Nor by your head must you swear, because you cannot turn one hair white or black.
Matthew	40	5	37	Just let YOUR word Yes mean Yes, YOUR No, No; for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one.
Matthew	40	5	38	“YOU heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’
Matthew	40	5	39	However, I say to YOU: Do not resist him that is wicked; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.
Matthew	40	5	40	And if a person wants to go to court with you and get possession of your inner garment, let your outer garment also go to him;
Matthew	40	5	41	and if someone under authority impresses you into service for a mile, go with him two miles.
Matthew	40	5	42	Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one that wants to borrow from you without interest.
Matthew	40	5	43	“YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
Matthew	40	5	44	However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU;
Matthew	40	5	45	that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.
Matthew	40	5	46	For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing?
Matthew	40	5	47	And if YOU greet YOUR brothers only, what extraordinary thing are YOU doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing?
Matthew	40	5	48	YOU must accordingly be perfect, as YOUR heavenly Father is perfect.

Matthew	40	6	1	“Take good care not to practice YOUR righteousness in front of men in order to be observed by them; otherwise YOU will have no reward with YOUR Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew	40	6	2	Hence when you go making gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, just as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to YOU, They are having their reward in full.
Matthew	40	6	3	But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right is doing,
Matthew	40	6	4	that your gifts of mercy may be in secret; then your Father who is looking on in secret will repay you.
Matthew	40	6	5	“Also, when YOU pray, YOU must not be as the hypocrites; because they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways to be visible to men. Truly I say to YOU, They are having their reward in full.
Matthew	40	6	6	You, however, when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.
Matthew	40	6	7	But when praying, do not say the same things over and over again, just as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words.
Matthew	40	6	8	So, do not make yourselves like them, for God YOUR Father knows what things YOU are needing before ever YOU ask him.
Matthew	40	6	9	“YOU must pray, then, this way: “‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.
Matthew	40	6	10	Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.
Matthew	40	6	11	Give us today our bread for this day;
Matthew	40	6	12	and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Matthew	40	6	13	And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.’
Matthew	40	6	14	“For if YOU forgive men their trespasses, YOUR heavenly Father will also forgive YOU;
Matthew	40	6	15	whereas if YOU do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will YOUR Father forgive YOUR trespasses.
Matthew	40	6	16	“When YOU are fasting, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to YOU, They are having their reward in full.
Matthew	40	6	17	But you, when fasting, grease your head and wash your face,
Matthew	40	6	18	that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.
Matthew	40	6	19	“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.
Matthew	40	6	20	Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Matthew	40	6	21	For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Matthew	40	6	22	“The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright;
Matthew	40	6	23	but if your eye is wicked, your whole body will be dark. If in reality the light that is in you is darkness, how great that darkness is!
Matthew	40	6	24	“No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. YOU cannot slave for God and for Riches.
Matthew	40	6	25	“On this account I say to YOU: Stop being anxious about YOUR souls as to what YOU will eat or what YOU will drink, or about YOUR bodies as to what YOU will wear. Does not the soul mean more than food and the body than clothing?
Matthew	40	6	26	Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still YOUR heavenly Father feeds them. Are YOU not worth more than they are?
Matthew	40	6	27	Who of YOU by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?
Matthew	40	6	28	Also, on the matter of clothing, why are YOU anxious? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they are growing; they do not toil, nor do they spin;
Matthew	40	6	29	but I say to YOU that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
Matthew	40	6	30	If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe YOU, YOU with little faith?
Matthew	40	6	31	So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’
Matthew	40	6	32	For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For YOUR heavenly Father knows YOU need all these things.
Matthew	40	6	33	“Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to YOU.
Matthew	40	6	34	So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Sufficient for each day is its own badness.

Matthew	40	7	1	“Stop judging that YOU may not be judged;
Matthew	40	7	2	for with what judgment YOU are judging, YOU will be judged; and with the measure that YOU are measuring out, they will measure out to YOU.
Matthew	40	7	3	Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye?
Matthew	40	7	4	Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to extract the straw from your eye’; when, look! a rafter is in your own eye?
Matthew	40	7	5	Hypocrite! First extract the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother’s eye.
Matthew	40	7	6	“Do not give what is holy to dogs, neither throw YOUR pearls before swine, that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip YOU open.
Matthew	40	7	7	“Keep on asking, and it will be given YOU; keep on seeking, and YOU will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to YOU.
Matthew	40	7	8	For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking it will be opened.
Matthew	40	7	9	Indeed, who is the man among YOU whom his son asks for bread—he will not hand him a stone, will he?
Matthew	40	7	10	Or, perhaps, he will ask for a fish—he will not hand him a serpent, will he?
Matthew	40	7	11	Therefore, if YOU, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to YOUR children, how much more so will YOUR Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?
Matthew	40	7	12	“All things, therefore, that YOU want men to do to YOU, YOU also must likewise do to them; this, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.
Matthew	40	7	13	“Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it;
Matthew	40	7	14	whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.
Matthew	40	7	15	“Be on the watch for the false prophets that come to YOU in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves.
Matthew	40	7	16	By their fruits YOU will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?
Matthew	40	7	17	Likewise every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit;
Matthew	40	7	18	a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, neither can a rotten tree produce fine fruit.
Matthew	40	7	19	Every tree not producing fine fruit gets cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew	40	7	20	Really, then, by their fruits YOU will recognize those men.
Matthew	40	7	21	“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.
Matthew	40	7	22	Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’
Matthew	40	7	23	And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew YOU! Get away from me, YOU workers of lawlessness.
Matthew	40	7	24	“Therefore everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rock-mass.
Matthew	40	7	25	And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded upon the rock-mass.
Matthew	40	7	26	Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.
Matthew	40	7	27	And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”
Matthew	40	7	28	Now when Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching;
Matthew	40	7	29	for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.

Matthew	40	8	1	After he had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him.
Matthew	40	8	2	And, look! a leprous man came up and began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”
Matthew	40	8	3	And so, stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to. Be made clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.
Matthew	40	8	4	Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for the purpose of a witness to them.”
Matthew	40	8	5	When he entered into Capernaum, an army officer came to him, entreating him
Matthew	40	8	6	and saying: “Sir, my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis, being terribly tormented.”
Matthew	40	8	7	He said to him: “When I get there I will cure him.”
Matthew	40	8	8	In reply the army officer said: “Sir, I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof, but just say the word and my manservant will be healed.
Matthew	40	8	9	For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Be on your way!’ and he is on his way, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
Matthew	40	8	10	Hearing that, Jesus became amazed and said to those following him: “I tell YOU the truth, With no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.
Matthew	40	8	11	But I tell YOU that many from eastern parts and western parts will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;
Matthew	40	8	12	whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.”
Matthew	40	8	13	Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as it has been your faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the manservant was healed in that hour.
Matthew	40	8	14	And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.
Matthew	40	8	15	So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.
Matthew	40	8	16	But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed persons; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were faring badly;
Matthew	40	8	17	that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”
Matthew	40	8	18	When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to shove off for the other side.
Matthew	40	8	19	And a certain scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you are about to go.”
Matthew	40	8	20	But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”
Matthew	40	8	21	Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to leave and bury my father.”
Matthew	40	8	22	Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”
Matthew	40	8	23	And when he got aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.
Matthew	40	8	24	Now, look! a great agitation arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; he, however, was sleeping.
Matthew	40	8	25	And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”
Matthew	40	8	26	But he said to them: “Why are YOU fainthearted, YOU with little faith?” Then, getting up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.
Matthew	40	8	27	So the men became amazed and said: “What sort of person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”
Matthew	40	8	28	When he got to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demon-possessed men coming out from among the memorial tombs, unusually fierce, so that nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.
Matthew	40	8	29	And, look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”
Matthew	40	8	30	But a long way off from them a herd of many swine was at pasture.
Matthew	40	8	31	So the demons began to entreat him, saying: “If you expel us, send us forth into the herd of swine.”
Matthew	40	8	32	Accordingly he said to them: “Go!” They came out and went off into the swine; and, look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.
Matthew	40	8	33	But the herders fled and, going into the city, they reported everything, including the affair of the demon-possessed men.
Matthew	40	8	34	And, look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus; and after having seen him, they earnestly urged him to move out from their districts.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	9	1	So, boarding the boat, he proceeded across and went into his own city.
Matthew	40	9	2	And, look! they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. On seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic: “Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.”
Matthew	40	9	3	And, look! certain of the scribes said to themselves: “This fellow is blaspheming.”
Matthew	40	9	4	And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “Why are YOU thinking wicked things in YOUR hearts?
Matthew	40	9	5	For instance, which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up and walk?
Matthew	40	9	6	However, in order for YOU to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” then he said to the paralytic: “Get up, pick up your bed, and go to your home.”
Matthew	40	9	7	And he got up and went off to his home.
Matthew	40	9	8	At the sight of this the crowds were struck with fear, and they glorified God, who gave such authority to men.
Matthew	40	9	9	Next, while passing along from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew seated at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” Thereupon he did rise up and follow him.
Matthew	40	9	10	Later, while he was reclining at the table in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew	40	9	11	But on seeing this the Pharisees began to say to his disciples: “Why is it that YOUR teacher eats with tax collectors and sinners?”
Matthew	40	9	12	Hearing them, he said: “Persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.
Matthew	40	9	13	Go, then, and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”
Matthew	40	9	14	Then John’s disciples came to him and asked: “Why is it that we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast?”
Matthew	40	9	15	At this Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, do they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
Matthew	40	9	16	Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old outer garment; for its full strength would pull from the outer garment and the tear would become worse.
Matthew	40	9	17	Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.”
Matthew	40	9	18	While he was telling them these things, look! a certain ruler who had approached began to do obeisance to him, saying: “By now my daughter must be dead; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will come to life.”
Matthew	40	9	19	Then Jesus, getting up, began to follow him; also his disciples did.
Matthew	40	9	20	And, look! a woman suffering twelve years from a flow of blood came up behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment;
Matthew	40	9	21	for she kept saying to herself: “If I only touch his outer garment I shall get well.”
Matthew	40	9	22	Jesus turned around and, noticing her, said: “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And from that hour the woman became well.
Matthew	40	9	23	When, now, he came into the ruler’s house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd in noisy confusion,
Matthew	40	9	24	Jesus began to say: “Leave the place, for the little girl did not die, but she is sleeping.” At this they began to laugh at him scornfully.
Matthew	40	9	25	As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, and the little girl got up.
Matthew	40	9	26	Of course, the talk about this spread out into all that region.
Matthew	40	9	27	As Jesus was passing along from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”
Matthew	40	9	28	After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: “Do YOU have faith that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord.”
Matthew	40	9	29	Then he touched their eyes, saying: “According to YOUR faith let it happen to YOU.”
Matthew	40	9	30	And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly charged them, saying: “See that nobody gets to know it.”
Matthew	40	9	31	But they, after getting outside, made it public about him in all that region.
Matthew	40	9	32	Now when they were leaving, look! people brought him a dumb man possessed of a demon;
Matthew	40	9	33	and after the demon had been expelled the dumb man spoke. Well, the crowds felt amazement and said: “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.”
Matthew	40	9	34	But the Pharisees began to say: “It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.”
Matthew	40	9	35	And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.
Matthew	40	9	36	On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.
Matthew	40	9	37	Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.
Matthew	40	9	38	Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	10	1	So he summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.
Matthew	40	10	2	The names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, the one called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee and John his brother;
Matthew	40	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew	40	10	4	Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.
Matthew	40	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these orders: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Samaritan city;
Matthew	40	10	6	but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew	40	10	7	As YOU go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’
Matthew	40	10	8	Cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. YOU received free, give free.
Matthew	40	10	9	Do not procure gold or silver or copper for YOUR girdle purses,
Matthew	40	10	10	or a food pouch for the trip, or two undergarments, or sandals or a staff; for the worker deserves his food.
Matthew	40	10	11	“Into whatever city or village YOU enter, search out who in it is deserving, and stay there until YOU leave.
Matthew	40	10	12	When YOU are entering into the house, greet the household;
Matthew	40	10	13	and if the house is deserving, let the peace YOU wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from YOU return upon YOU.
Matthew	40	10	14	Wherever anyone does not take YOU in or listen to YOUR words, on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off YOUR feet.
Matthew	40	10	15	Truly I say to YOU, It will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city.
Matthew	40	10	16	“Look! I am sending YOU forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.
Matthew	40	10	17	Be on YOUR guard against men; for they will deliver YOU up to local courts, and they will scourge YOU in their synagogues.
Matthew	40	10	18	Why, YOU will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.
Matthew	40	10	19	However, when they deliver YOU up, do not become anxious about how or what YOU are to speak; for what YOU are to speak will be given YOU in that hour;
Matthew	40	10	20	for the ones speaking are not just YOU, but it is the spirit of YOUR Father that speaks by YOU.
Matthew	40	10	21	Further, brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death.
Matthew	40	10	22	And YOU will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.
Matthew	40	10	23	When they persecute YOU in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to YOU, YOU will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.
Matthew	40	10	24	“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord.
Matthew	40	10	25	It is enough for the disciple to become as his teacher, and the slave as his lord. If people have called the householder Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household so?
Matthew	40	10	26	Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known.
Matthew	40	10	27	What I tell YOU in the darkness, say in the light; and what YOU hear whispered, preach from the housetops.
Matthew	40	10	28	And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
Matthew	40	10	29	Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without YOUR Father’s knowledge.
Matthew	40	10	30	But the very hairs of YOUR head are all numbered.
Matthew	40	10	31	Therefore have no fear: YOU are worth more than many sparrows.
Matthew	40	10	32	“Everyone, then, that confesses union with me before men, I will also confess union with him before my Father who is in the heavens;
Matthew	40	10	33	but whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew	40	10	34	Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth; I came to put, not peace, but a sword.
Matthew	40	10	35	For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law.
Matthew	40	10	36	Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.
Matthew	40	10	37	He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me.
Matthew	40	10	38	And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me.
Matthew	40	10	39	He that finds his soul will lose it, and he that loses his soul for my sake will find it.
Matthew	40	10	40	“He that receives YOU receives me also, and he that receives me receives him also that sent me forth.
Matthew	40	10	41	He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet’s reward, and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew	40	10	42	And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I tell YOU truly, he will by no means lose his reward.”

Matthew	40	11	1	Now when Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew	40	11	2	But John, having heard in jail about the works of the Christ, sent by means of his own disciples
Matthew	40	11	3	and said to him: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?”
Matthew	40	11	4	In reply Jesus said to them: “Go YOUR way and report to John what YOU are hearing and seeing:
Matthew	40	11	5	The blind are seeing again, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, and the dead are being raised up, and the poor are having the good news declared to them;
Matthew	40	11	6	and happy is he that finds no cause for stumbling in me.”
Matthew	40	11	7	While these were on their way, Jesus started to say to the crowds respecting John: “What did YOU go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed being tossed by a wind?
Matthew	40	11	8	What, then, did YOU go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings.
Matthew	40	11	9	Really, then, why did YOU go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell YOU, and far more than a prophet.
Matthew	40	11	10	This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Look! I myself am sending forth my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way ahead of you!’
Matthew	40	11	11	Truly I say to YOU people, Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.
Matthew	40	11	12	But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it.
Matthew	40	11	13	For all, the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John;
Matthew	40	11	14	and if YOU want to accept it, He himself is ‘Elijah who is destined to come.’
Matthew	40	11	15	Let him that has ears listen.
Matthew	40	11	16	“With whom shall I compare this generation? It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who cry out to their playmates,
Matthew	40	11	17	saying, ‘We played the flute for YOU, but YOU did not dance; we wailed, but YOU did not beat yourselves in grief.’
Matthew	40	11	18	Correspondingly, John came neither eating nor drinking, yet people say, ‘He has a demon’;
Matthew	40	11	19	the Son of man did come eating and drinking, still people say, ‘Look! A man gluttonous and given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”
Matthew	40	11	20	Then he started to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place, because they did not repent:
Matthew	40	11	21	“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! because if the powerful works had taken place in Tyre and Sidon that took place in YOU, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew	40	11	22	Consequently I say to YOU, It will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgment Day than for YOU.
Matthew	40	11	23	And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to Hades you will come; because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this very day.
Matthew	40	11	24	Consequently I say to YOU people, It will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day than for you.”
Matthew	40	11	25	At that time Jesus said in response: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to babes.
Matthew	40	11	26	Yes, O Father, because to do thus came to be the way approved by you.
Matthew	40	11	27	All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.
Matthew	40	11	28	Come to me, all YOU who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh YOU.
Matthew	40	11	29	Take my yoke upon YOU and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and YOU will find refreshment for YOUR souls.
Matthew	40	11	30	For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.”

Matthew	40	12	1	At that season Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
Matthew	40	12	2	At seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.”
Matthew	40	12	3	He said to them: “Have YOU not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry?
Matthew	40	12	4	How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?
Matthew	40	12	5	Or, have YOU not read in the Law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple treat the sabbath as not sacred and continue guiltless?
Matthew	40	12	6	But I tell YOU that something greater than the temple is here.
Matthew	40	12	7	However, if YOU had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice,’ YOU would not have condemned the guiltless ones.
Matthew	40	12	8	For Lord of the sabbath is what the Son of man is.”
Matthew	40	12	9	After departing from that place he went into their synagogue;
Matthew	40	12	10	and, look! a man with a withered hand! So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath?” that they might get an accusation against him.
Matthew	40	12	11	He said to them: “Who will be the man among YOU that has one sheep and, if this falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not get hold of it and lift it out?
Matthew	40	12	12	All considered, of how much more worth is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the sabbath.”
Matthew	40	12	13	Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand.
Matthew	40	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him that they might destroy him.
Matthew	40	12	15	Having come to know this, Jesus withdrew from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all,
Matthew	40	12	16	but he strictly charged them not to make him manifest;
Matthew	40	12	17	that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:
Matthew	40	12	18	“Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom my soul approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations.
Matthew	40	12	19	He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.
Matthew	40	12	20	No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering flaxen wick will he extinguish, until he sends out justice with success.
Matthew	40	12	21	Indeed, in his name nations will hope.”
Matthew	40	12	22	Then they brought him a demon-possessed man, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
Matthew	40	12	23	Well, all the crowds were simply carried away and began to say: “May this not perhaps be the Son of David?”
Matthew	40	12	24	At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.”
Matthew	40	12	25	Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
Matthew	40	12	26	In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand?
Matthew	40	12	27	Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub, by means of whom do YOUR sons expel them? This is why they will be judges of YOU.
Matthew	40	12	28	But if it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken YOU.
Matthew	40	12	29	Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his movable goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
Matthew	40	12	30	He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.
Matthew	40	12	31	“On this account I say to YOU, Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.
Matthew	40	12	32	For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.
Matthew	40	12	33	“Either YOU people make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.
Matthew	40	12	34	Offspring of vipers, how can YOU speak good things, when YOU are wicked? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
Matthew	40	12	35	The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things.
Matthew	40	12	36	I tell YOU that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day;
Matthew	40	12	37	for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.”
Matthew	40	12	38	Then as an answer to him some of the scribes and Pharisees said: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
Matthew	40	12	39	In reply he said to them: “A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
Matthew	40	12	40	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
Matthew	40	12	41	Men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repented at what Jonah preached, but, look! something more than Jonah is here.
Matthew	40	12	42	The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, but, look! something more than Solomon is here.
Matthew	40	12	43	“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through parched places in search of a resting-place, and finds none.
Matthew	40	12	44	Then it says, ‘I will go back to my house out of which I moved’; and on arriving it finds it unoccupied but swept clean and adorned.
Matthew	40	12	45	Then it goes its way and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and, after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.”
Matthew	40	12	46	While he was yet speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and brothers took up a position outside seeking to speak to him.
Matthew	40	12	47	So someone said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.”
Matthew	40	12	48	As an answer he said to the one telling him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
Matthew	40	12	49	And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: “Look! My mother and my brothers!
Matthew	40	12	50	For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.”

Matthew	40	13	1	On that day Jesus, having left the house, was sitting by the sea;
Matthew	40	13	2	and great crowds gathered to him, so that he went aboard a boat and sat down, and all the crowd was standing on the beach.
Matthew	40	13	3	Then he told them many things by illustrations, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow;
Matthew	40	13	4	and as he was sowing, some seeds fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.
Matthew	40	13	5	Others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil, and at once they sprang up because of not having depth of soil.
Matthew	40	13	6	But when the sun rose they were scorched, and because of not having root they withered.
Matthew	40	13	7	Others, too, fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
Matthew	40	13	8	Still others fell upon the fine soil and they began to yield fruit, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.
Matthew	40	13	9	Let him that has ears listen.”
Matthew	40	13	10	So the disciples came up and said to him: “Why is it you speak to them by the use of illustrations?”
Matthew	40	13	11	In reply he said: “To YOU it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those people it is not granted.
Matthew	40	13	12	For whoever has, more will be given him and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
Matthew	40	13	13	This is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations, because, looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, neither do they get the sense of it;
Matthew	40	13	14	and toward them the prophecy of Isaiah is having fulfillment, which says, ‘By hearing, YOU will hear but by no means get the sense of it; and, looking, YOU will look but by no means see.
Matthew	40	13	15	For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes; that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back, and I heal them.’
Matthew	40	13	16	“However, happy are YOUR eyes because they behold, and YOUR ears because they hear.
Matthew	40	13	17	For I truly say to YOU, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things YOU are beholding and did not see them, and to hear the things YOU are hearing and did not hear them.
Matthew	40	13	18	“YOU, then, listen to the illustration of the man that sowed.
Matthew	40	13	19	Where anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road.
Matthew	40	13	20	As for the one sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy.
Matthew	40	13	21	Yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled.
Matthew	40	13	22	As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
Matthew	40	13	23	As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.”
Matthew	40	13	24	Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man that sowed fine seed in his field.
Matthew	40	13	25	While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat, and left.
Matthew	40	13	26	When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds appeared also.
Matthew	40	13	27	So the slaves of the householder came up and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it come to have weeds?’
Matthew	40	13	28	He said to them, ‘An enemy, a man, did this.’ They said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?’
Matthew	40	13	29	He said, ‘No; that by no chance, while collecting the weeds, YOU uproot the wheat with them.
Matthew	40	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up, then go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.’”
Matthew	40	13	31	Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain, which a man took and planted in his field;
Matthew	40	13	32	which is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the largest of the vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches.”
Matthew	40	13	33	Another illustration he spoke to them: “The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three large measures of flour, until the whole mass was fermented.”
Matthew	40	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them;
Matthew	40	13	35	that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet who said: “I will open my mouth with illustrations, I will publish things hidden since the founding.”
Matthew	40	13	36	Then after dismissing the crowds he went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: “Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.”
Matthew	40	13	37	In response he said: “The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man;
Matthew	40	13	38	the field is the world; as for the fine seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one,
Matthew	40	13	39	and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things, and the reapers are angels.
Matthew	40	13	40	Therefore, just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things.
Matthew	40	13	41	The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and persons who are doing lawlessness,
Matthew	40	13	42	and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.
Matthew	40	13	43	At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him that has ears listen.
Matthew	40	13	44	“The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid; and for the joy he has he goes and sells what things he has and buys that field.
Matthew	40	13	45	“Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls.
Matthew	40	13	46	Upon finding one pearl of high value, away he went and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.
Matthew	40	13	47	“Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering up fish of every kind.
Matthew	40	13	48	When it got full they hauled it up onto the beach and, sitting down, they collected the fine ones into vessels, but the unsuitable they threw away.
Matthew	40	13	49	That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things: the angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous
Matthew	40	13	50	and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.
Matthew	40	13	51	“Did YOU get the sense of all these things?” They said to him: “Yes.”
Matthew	40	13	52	Then he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.”
Matthew	40	13	53	Now when Jesus had finished these illustrations he went across country from there.
Matthew	40	13	54	And after coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: “Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works?
Matthew	40	13	55	Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew	40	13	56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man get all these things?”
Matthew	40	13	57	So they began to stumble at him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not unhonored except in his home territory and in his own house.”
Matthew	40	13	58	And he did not do many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.

Matthew	40	14	1	At that particular time Herod, the district ruler, heard the report about Jesus
Matthew	40	14	2	and said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why the powerful works are operating in him.”
Matthew	40	14	3	For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him away in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.
Matthew	40	14	4	For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to be having her.”
Matthew	40	14	5	However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet.
Matthew	40	14	6	But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the daughter of Herodias danced at it and pleased Herod so much
Matthew	40	14	7	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
Matthew	40	14	8	Then she, under her mother’s coaching, said: “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
Matthew	40	14	9	Grieved though he was, the king out of regard for his oaths and for those reclining with him commanded it to be given;
Matthew	40	14	10	and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
Matthew	40	14	11	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew	40	14	12	Finally his disciples came up and removed the corpse and buried him and came and reported to Jesus.
Matthew	40	14	13	At hearing this Jesus withdrew from there by boat into a lonely place for isolation; but the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.
Matthew	40	14	14	Now when he came forth he saw a great crowd; and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones.
Matthew	40	14	15	But when evening fell his disciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely and the hour is already far advanced; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves things to eat.”
Matthew	40	14	16	However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave: YOU give them something to eat.”
Matthew	40	14	17	They said to him: “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes.”
Matthew	40	14	18	He said: “BRING them here to me.”
Matthew	40	14	19	Next he commanded the crowds to recline on the grass and took the five loaves and two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he said a blessing and, after breaking the loaves, he distributed them to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.
Matthew	40	14	20	So all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the surplus of fragments, twelve baskets full.
Matthew	40	14	21	Yet those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and young children.
Matthew	40	14	22	Then, without delay, he compelled his disciples to board the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
Matthew	40	14	23	Eventually, having sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. Though it became late, he was there alone.
Matthew	40	14	24	By now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land, being hard put to it by the waves, because the wind was against them.
Matthew	40	14	25	But in the fourth watch period of the night he came to them, walking over the sea.
Matthew	40	14	26	When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear.
Matthew	40	14	27	But at once Jesus spoke to them with the words: “Take courage, it is I; have no fear.”
Matthew	40	14	28	In reply Peter said to him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.”
Matthew	40	14	29	He said: “Come!” Thereupon Peter, getting down off the boat, walked over the waters and went toward Jesus.
Matthew	40	14	30	But looking at the windstorm, he got afraid and, after starting to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”
Matthew	40	14	31	Immediately stretching out his hand Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?”
Matthew	40	14	32	And after they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated.
Matthew	40	14	33	Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: “You are really God’s Son.”
Matthew	40	14	34	And they got across and came to land in Gennesaret.
Matthew	40	14	35	Upon recognizing him the men of that place sent forth into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill.
Matthew	40	14	36	And they went entreating him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment; and all those who touched it were made completely well.

Matthew	40	15	1	Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying:
Matthew	40	15	2	“Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal.”
Matthew	40	15	3	In reply he said to them: “Why is it YOU also overstep the commandment of God because of YOUR tradition?
Matthew	40	15	4	For example, God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Let him that reviles father or mother end up in death.’
Matthew	40	15	5	But YOU say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother: “Whatever I have by which you might get benefit from me is a gift dedicated to God,”
Matthew	40	15	6	he must not honor his father at all.’ And so YOU have made the word of God invalid because of YOUR tradition.
Matthew	40	15	7	YOU hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about YOU, when he said,
Matthew	40	15	8	‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.
Matthew	40	15	9	It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”
Matthew	40	15	10	With that he called the crowd near and said to them: “Listen and get the sense of it:
Matthew	40	15	11	Not what enters into his mouth defiles a man; but it is what proceeds out of his mouth that defiles a man.”
Matthew	40	15	12	Then the disciples came up and said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees stumbled at hearing what you said?”
Matthew	40	15	13	In reply he said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.
Matthew	40	15	14	LET them be. Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”
Matthew	40	15	15	By way of response Peter said to him: “Make the illustration plain to us.”
Matthew	40	15	16	At this he said: “Are YOU also yet without understanding?
Matthew	40	15	17	Are YOU not aware that everything entering into the mouth passes along into the intestines and is discharged into the sewer?
Matthew	40	15	18	However, the things proceeding out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those things defile a man.
Matthew	40	15	19	For example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thieveries, false testimonies, blasphemies.
Matthew	40	15	20	These are the things defiling a man; but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”
Matthew	40	15	21	Leaving there, Jesus now withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew	40	15	22	And, look! a Phoenician woman from those regions came out and cried aloud, saying: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is badly demonized.”
Matthew	40	15	23	But he did not say a word in answer to her. So his disciples came up and began to request him: “Send her away; because she keeps crying out after us.”
Matthew	40	15	24	In answer he said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
Matthew	40	15	25	When the woman came she began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, help me!”
Matthew	40	15	26	In answer he said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.”
Matthew	40	15	27	She said: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”
Matthew	40	15	28	Then Jesus said in reply to her: “O woman, great is your faith; let it happen to you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed from that hour on.
Matthew	40	15	29	Crossing country from there, Jesus next came near the sea of Galilee, and, after going up into the mountain, he was sitting there.
Matthew	40	15	30	Then great crowds approached him, having along with them people that were lame, maimed, blind, dumb, and many otherwise, and they fairly threw them at his feet, and he cured them;
Matthew	40	15	31	so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb speaking and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew	40	15	32	But Jesus called his disciples to him and said: “I feel pity for the crowd, because it is already three days that they have stayed with me and they have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away fasting. They may possibly give out on the road.”
Matthew	40	15	33	However, the disciples said to him: “Where are we in this lonely place going to get sufficient loaves to satisfy a crowd of this size?”
Matthew	40	15	34	At this Jesus said to them: “How many loaves have YOU?” They said: “Seven, and a few little fishes.”
Matthew	40	15	35	So, after instructing the crowd to recline upon the ground,
Matthew	40	15	36	he took the seven loaves and the fishes and, after offering thanks, he broke them and began distributing to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.
Matthew	40	15	37	And all ate and were satisfied, and as a surplus of fragments they took up seven provision baskets full.
Matthew	40	15	38	Yet those eating were four thousand men, besides women and young children.
Matthew	40	15	39	Finally, after sending the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the regions of Magadan.

Matthew	40	16	1	Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him and, to tempt him, they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven.
Matthew	40	16	2	In reply he said to them: “When evening falls YOU are accustomed to say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red’;
Matthew	40	16	3	and at morning, ‘It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red, but gloomy-looking.’ YOU know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times YOU cannot interpret.
Matthew	40	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” With that he went away, leaving them behind.
Matthew	40	16	5	Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take loaves along.
Matthew	40	16	6	Jesus said to them: “Keep YOUR eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Matthew	40	16	7	So they began to reason among themselves, saying: “We did not take any loaves along.”
Matthew	40	16	8	Knowing this, Jesus said: “Why are YOU doing this reasoning among yourselves, because YOU have no loaves, YOU with little faith?
Matthew	40	16	9	Do YOU not yet see the point, or do YOU not remember the five loaves in the case of the five thousand and how many baskets YOU took up?
Matthew	40	16	10	Or the seven loaves in the case of the four thousand and how many provision baskets YOU took up?
Matthew	40	16	11	How is it YOU do not discern that I did not talk to YOU about loaves? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Matthew	40	16	12	Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew	40	16	13	Now when he had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus went asking his disciples: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?”
Matthew	40	16	14	They said: “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
Matthew	40	16	15	He said to them: “YOU, though, who do YOU say I am?”
Matthew	40	16	16	In answer Simon Peter said: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
Matthew	40	16	17	In response Jesus said to him: “Happy you are, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but my Father who is in the heavens did.
Matthew	40	16	18	Also, I say to you, You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
Matthew	40	16	19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will be the thing bound in the heavens, and whatever you may loose on earth will be the thing loosed in the heavens.”
Matthew	40	16	20	Then he sternly charged the disciples not to say to anybody that he was the Christ.
Matthew	40	16	21	From that time forward Jesus Christ commenced showing his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
Matthew	40	16	22	At this Peter took him aside and commenced rebuking him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all.”
Matthew	40	16	23	But, turning his back, he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”
Matthew	40	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.
Matthew	40	16	25	For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.
Matthew	40	16	26	For what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Matthew	40	16	27	For the Son of man is destined to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will recompense each one according to his behavior.
Matthew	40	16	28	Truly I say to YOU that there are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.”

Matthew	40	17	1	Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother along and brought them up into a lofty mountain by themselves.
Matthew	40	17	2	And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant as the light.
Matthew	40	17	3	And, look! there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, conversing with him.
Matthew	40	17	4	Responsively Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, it is fine for us to be here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
Matthew	40	17	5	While he was yet speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and, look! a voice out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him.”
Matthew	40	17	6	At hearing this the disciples fell upon their faces and became very much afraid.
Matthew	40	17	7	Then Jesus came near and, touching them, said: “Get up and have no fear.”
Matthew	40	17	8	When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself only.
Matthew	40	17	9	And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.”
Matthew	40	17	10	However, the disciples put the question to him: “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
Matthew	40	17	11	In reply he said: “Elijah, indeed, is coming and will restore all things.
Matthew	40	17	12	However, I say to YOU that Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but did with him the things they wanted. In this way also the Son of man is destined to suffer at their hands.”
Matthew	40	17	13	Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.
Matthew	40	17	14	And when they came toward the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down to him and saying:
Matthew	40	17	15	“Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill, for he falls often into the fire and often into the water;
Matthew	40	17	16	and I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”
Matthew	40	17	17	In reply Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with YOU? How long must I put up with YOU? Bring him here to me.”
Matthew	40	17	18	Then Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out of him; and the boy was cured from that hour.
Matthew	40	17	19	Thereupon the disciples came up to Jesus privately and said: “Why is it we could not expel it?”
Matthew	40	17	20	He said to them: “Because of YOUR little faith. For truly I say to YOU, If YOU have faith the size of a mustard grain, YOU will say to this mountain, ‘Transfer from here to there,’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for YOU.”
Matthew	40	17	21	——
Matthew	40	17	22	It was while they were gathered together in Galilee that Jesus said to them: “The Son of man is destined to be betrayed into men’s hands,
Matthew	40	17	23	and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” Consequently they were very much grieved.
Matthew	40	17	24	After they arrived in Capernaum the men collecting the two drachmas tax approached Peter and said: “Does YOUR teacher not pay the two drachmas tax?”
Matthew	40	17	25	He said: “Yes.” However, when he entered the house Jesus got ahead of him by saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax? From their sons or from the strangers?”
Matthew	40	17	26	When he said: “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him: “Really, then, the sons are tax-free.
Matthew	40	17	27	But that we do not cause them to stumble, you go to the sea, cast a fishhook, and take the first fish coming up and, when you open its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	18	1	In that hour the disciples came near to Jesus and said: “Who really is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”
Matthew	40	18	2	So, calling a young child to him, he set it in their midst
Matthew	40	18	3	and said: “Truly I say to YOU, Unless YOU turn around and become as young children, YOU will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew	40	18	4	Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one that is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens;
Matthew	40	18	5	and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me also.
Matthew	40	18	6	But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who put faith in me, it is more beneficial for him to have hung around his neck a millstone such as is turned by an ass and to be sunk in the wide, open sea.
Matthew	40	18	7	“Woe to the world due to the stumbling blocks! Of course, the stumbling blocks must of necessity come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!
Matthew	40	18	8	If, then, your hand or your foot is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire.
Matthew	40	18	9	Also, if your eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Gehenna.
Matthew	40	18	10	See to it that YOU men do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell YOU that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew	40	18	11	——
Matthew	40	18	12	“What do YOU think? If a certain man comes to have a hundred sheep and one of them gets strayed, will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying?
Matthew	40	18	13	And if he happens to find it, I certainly tell YOU, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed.
Matthew	40	18	14	Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.
Matthew	40	18	15	“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
Matthew	40	18	16	But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.
Matthew	40	18	17	If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.
Matthew	40	18	18	“Truly I say to YOU men, Whatever things YOU may bind on earth will be things bound in heaven, and whatever things YOU may loose on earth will be things loosed in heaven.
Matthew	40	18	19	Again I truly say to YOU, If two of YOU on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request, it will take place for them due to my Father in heaven.
Matthew	40	18	20	For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”
Matthew	40	18	21	Then Peter came up and said to him: “Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Matthew	40	18	22	Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy-seven times.
Matthew	40	18	23	“That is why the kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
Matthew	40	18	24	When he started to settle them, there was brought in a man who owed him ten thousand talents =60,000,000 denarii.
Matthew	40	18	25	But because he did not have the means to pay it back, his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he had to be sold and payment to be made.
Matthew	40	18	26	Therefore the slave fell down and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay back everything to you.’
Matthew	40	18	27	Moved to pity at this, the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt.
Matthew	40	18	28	But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves that was owing him a hundred denarii; and, grabbing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back whatever you owe.’
Matthew	40	18	29	Therefore his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay you back.’
Matthew	40	18	30	However, he was not willing, but went off and had him thrown into prison until he should pay back what was owing.
Matthew	40	18	31	When, therefore, his fellow slaves saw the things that had happened, they became very much grieved, and they went and made clear to their master all the things that had happened.
Matthew	40	18	32	Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you, when you entreated me.
Matthew	40	18	33	Ought you not, in turn, to have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I also had mercy on you?’
Matthew	40	18	34	With that his master, provoked to wrath, delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay back all that was owing.
Matthew	40	18	35	In like manner my heavenly Father will also deal with YOU if YOU do not forgive each one his brother from YOUR hearts.”

Matthew	40	19	1	Now when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came to the frontiers of Judea across the Jordan.
Matthew	40	19	2	Also, great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.
Matthew	40	19	3	And Pharisees came up to him, intent on tempting him and saying: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of ground?”
Matthew	40	19	4	In reply he said: “Did YOU not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female
Matthew	40	19	5	and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?
Matthew	40	19	6	So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.”
Matthew	40	19	7	They said to him: “Why, then, did Moses prescribe giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?”
Matthew	40	19	8	He said to them: “Moses, out of regard for YOUR hardheartedness, made the concession to YOU of divorcing YOUR wives, but such has not been the case from the beginning.
Matthew	40	19	9	I say to YOU that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.”
Matthew	40	19	10	The disciples said to him: “If such is the situation of a man with his wife, it is not advisable to marry.”
Matthew	40	19	11	He said to them: “Not all men make room for the saying, but only those who have the gift.
Matthew	40	19	12	For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs on account of the kingdom of the heavens. Let him that can make room for it make room for it.”
Matthew	40	19	13	Then young children were brought to him, for him to put his hands upon them and offer prayer; but the disciples reprimanded them.
Matthew	40	19	14	Jesus, however, said: “Let the young children alone, and stop hindering them from coming to me, for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to suchlike ones.”
Matthew	40	19	15	And he put his hands upon them and went from there.
Matthew	40	19	16	Now, look! a certain one came up to him and said: “Teacher, what good must I do in order to get everlasting life?”
Matthew	40	19	17	He said to him: “Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is that is good. If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.”
Matthew	40	19	18	He said to him: “Which ones?” Jesus said: “Why, You must not murder, You must not commit adultery, You must not steal, You must not bear false witness,
Matthew	40	19	19	Honor your father and your mother, and, You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
Matthew	40	19	20	The young man said to him: “I have kept all these; what yet am I lacking?”
Matthew	40	19	21	Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.”
Matthew	40	19	22	When the young man heard this saying, he went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions.
Matthew	40	19	23	But Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to YOU that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew	40	19	24	Again I say to YOU, It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.”
Matthew	40	19	25	When the disciples heard that, they expressed very great surprise, saying: “Who really can be saved?”
Matthew	40	19	26	Looking them in the face, Jesus said to them: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Matthew	40	19	27	Then Peter said to him in reply: “Look! We have left all things and followed you; what actually will there be for us?”
Matthew	40	19	28	Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU, In the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, YOU who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew	40	19	29	And everyone that has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive many times more and will inherit everlasting life.
Matthew	40	19	30	“But many that are first will be last and the last first.

Matthew	40	20	1	“For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
Matthew	40	20	2	When he had agreed with the workers for a denarius a day, he sent them forth into his vineyard.
Matthew	40	20	3	Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;
Matthew	40	20	4	and to those he said, ‘YOU also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is just I will give YOU.’
Matthew	40	20	5	So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.
Matthew	40	20	6	Finally, about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he said to them, ‘Why have YOU been standing here all day unemployed?’
Matthew	40	20	7	They said to him, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘YOU too go into the vineyard.’
Matthew	40	20	8	“When it became evening, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, proceeding from the last to the first.’
Matthew	40	20	9	When the eleventh-hour men came, they each received a denarius.
Matthew	40	20	10	So, when the first came, they concluded they would receive more; but they also received pay at the rate of a denarius.
Matthew	40	20	11	On receiving it they began to murmur against the householder
Matthew	40	20	12	and said, ‘These last put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’
Matthew	40	20	13	But in reply to one of them he said, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a denarius, did you not?
Matthew	40	20	14	Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you.
Matthew	40	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye wicked because I am good?’
Matthew	40	20	16	In this way the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.”
Matthew	40	20	17	Being now about to go up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples off privately and said to them on the road:
Matthew	40	20	18	“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
Matthew	40	20	19	and will deliver him up to men of the nations to make fun of and to scourge and to impale, and the third day he will be raised up.”
Matthew	40	20	20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him.
Matthew	40	20	21	He said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Give the word that these my two sons may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”
Matthew	40	20	22	Jesus said in answer: “YOU men do not know what YOU are asking for. Can YOU drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.”
Matthew	40	20	23	He said to them: “YOU will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
Matthew	40	20	24	When the ten others heard of this, they became indignant at the two brothers.
Matthew	40	20	25	But Jesus, calling them to him, said: “YOU know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.
Matthew	40	20	26	This is not the way among YOU; but whoever wants to become great among YOU must be YOUR minister,
Matthew	40	20	27	and whoever wants to be first among YOU must be YOUR slave.
Matthew	40	20	28	Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.”
Matthew	40	20	29	Now as they were going out of Jericho a great crowd followed him.
Matthew	40	20	30	And, look! two blind men sitting beside the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
Matthew	40	20	31	But the crowd sternly told them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
Matthew	40	20	32	So Jesus stopped, called them and said: “What do YOU want me to do for YOU?”
Matthew	40	20	33	They said to him: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
Matthew	40	20	34	Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received sight, and they followed him.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	21	1	Well, when they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent forth two disciples,
Matthew	40	21	2	saying to them: “Be on YOUR way into the village that is within sight of YOU, and YOU will at once find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.
Matthew	40	21	3	And if someone says anything to YOU, YOU must say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them forth.”
Matthew	40	21	4	This actually took place that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet, saying:
Matthew	40	21	5	“TELL the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! Your King is coming to you, mild-tempered, and mounted upon an ass, yes, upon a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”
Matthew	40	21	6	So the disciples got on their way and did just as Jesus ordered them.
Matthew	40	21	7	And they brought the ass and its colt, and they put upon these their outer garments, and he seated himself upon them.
Matthew	40	21	8	Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
Matthew	40	21	9	As for the crowds, those going ahead of him and those following kept crying out: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”
Matthew	40	21	10	Now when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was set in commotion, saying: “Who is this?”
Matthew	40	21	11	The crowds kept telling: “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee!”
Matthew	40	21	12	And Jesus entered into the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
Matthew	40	21	13	And he said to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but YOU are making it a cave of robbers.”
Matthew	40	21	14	Also, blind and lame persons came up to him in the temple, and he cured them.
Matthew	40	21	15	When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys that were crying out in the temple and saying: “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” they became indignant
Matthew	40	21	16	and said to him: “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes. Did YOU never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise’?”
Matthew	40	21	17	And leaving them behind he went outside the city to Bethany and passed the night there.
Matthew	40	21	18	While returning to the city early in the morning, he got hungry.
Matthew	40	21	19	And he caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves only, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you anymore forever.” And the fig tree withered instantly.
Matthew	40	21	20	But when the disciples saw this, they wondered, saying: “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”
Matthew	40	21	21	In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU, If only YOU have faith and do not doubt, not only will YOU do what I did to the fig tree, but also if YOU say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.
Matthew	40	21	22	And all the things YOU ask in prayer, having faith, YOU will receive.”
Matthew	40	21	23	Now after he went into the temple, the chief priests and the older men of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: “By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”
Matthew	40	21	24	In reply Jesus said to them: “I, also, will ask YOU one thing. If YOU tell it to me, I also will tell YOU by what authority I do these things:
Matthew	40	21	25	The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?” But they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why, then, did YOU not believe him?’
Matthew	40	21	26	If, though, we say, ‘From men,’ we have the crowd to fear, for they all hold John as a prophet.”
Matthew	40	21	27	So in answer to Jesus they said: “We do not know.” He, in turn, said to them: “Neither am I telling YOU by what authority I do these things.
Matthew	40	21	28	“What do YOU think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in the vineyard.’
Matthew	40	21	29	In answer this one said, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go out.
Matthew	40	21	30	Approaching the second, he said the same. In reply this one said, ‘I will not.’ Afterwards he felt regret and went out.
Matthew	40	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said: “The latter.” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU that the tax collectors and the harlots are going ahead of YOU into the kingdom of God.
Matthew	40	21	32	For John came to YOU in a way of righteousness, but YOU did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the harlots believed him, and YOU, although YOU saw this, did not feel regret afterwards so as to believe him.
Matthew	40	21	33	“Hear another illustration: There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad.
Matthew	40	21	34	When the season of the fruits came around, he dispatched his slaves to the cultivators to get his fruits.
Matthew	40	21	35	However, the cultivators took his slaves, and one they beat up, another they killed, another they stoned.
Matthew	40	21	36	Again he dispatched other slaves, more than the first, but they did the same to these.
Matthew	40	21	37	Lastly he dispatched his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
Matthew	40	21	38	On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’
Matthew	40	21	39	So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Matthew	40	21	40	Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?”
Matthew	40	21	41	They said to him: “Because they are evil, he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.”
Matthew	40	21	42	Jesus said to them: “Did YOU never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
Matthew	40	21	43	This is why I say to YOU, The kingdom of God will be taken from YOU and be given to a nation producing its fruits.
Matthew	40	21	44	Also, the person falling upon this stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.”
Matthew	40	21	45	Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his illustrations, they took note that he was speaking about them.
Matthew	40	21	46	But, although they were seeking to seize him, they feared the crowds, because these held him to be a prophet.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	22	1	In further reply Jesus again spoke to them with illustrations, saying:
Matthew	40	22	2	“The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that made a marriage feast for his son.
Matthew	40	22	3	And he sent forth his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come.
Matthew	40	22	4	Again he sent forth other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’
Matthew	40	22	5	But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his commercial business;
Matthew	40	22	6	but the rest, laying hold of his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.
Matthew	40	22	7	“But the king grew wrathful, and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Matthew	40	22	8	Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast indeed is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
Matthew	40	22	9	Therefore go to the roads leading out of the city, and anyone YOU find invite to the marriage feast.’
Matthew	40	22	10	Accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered together all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those reclining at the table.
Matthew	40	22	11	“When the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight there of a man not clothed with a marriage garment.
Matthew	40	22	12	So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here not having on a marriage garment?’ He was rendered speechless.
Matthew	40	22	13	Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’
Matthew	40	22	14	“For there are many invited, but few chosen.”
Matthew	40	22	15	Then the Pharisees went their way and took counsel together in order to trap him in his speech.
Matthew	40	22	16	So they dispatched to him their disciples, together with party followers of Herod, saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care for anybody, for you do not look upon men’s outward appearance.
Matthew	40	22	17	Tell us, therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?”
Matthew	40	22	18	But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do YOU put me to the test, hypocrites?
Matthew	40	22	19	Show me the head tax coin.” They brought him a denarius.
Matthew	40	22	20	And he said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?”
Matthew	40	22	21	They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”
Matthew	40	22	22	Well, when they heard that, they marveled, and leaving him they went off.
Matthew	40	22	23	On that day Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up to him and asked him:
Matthew	40	22	24	“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If any man dies without having children, his brother must take his wife in marriage and raise up offspring for his brother.’
Matthew	40	22	25	Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and deceased, and, not having offspring, he left his wife for his brother.
Matthew	40	22	26	It went the same way also with the second and the third, until through all seven.
Matthew	40	22	27	Last of all the woman died.
Matthew	40	22	28	Consequently, in the resurrection, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all got her.”
Matthew	40	22	29	In reply Jesus said to them: “YOU are mistaken, because YOU know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God;
Matthew	40	22	30	for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
Matthew	40	22	31	As regards the resurrection of the dead, did YOU not read what was spoken to YOU by God, saying,
Matthew	40	22	32	‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.”
Matthew	40	22	33	On hearing that, the crowds were astounded at his teaching.
Matthew	40	22	34	After the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together in one group.
Matthew	40	22	35	And one of them, versed in the Law, asked, testing him:
Matthew	40	22	36	“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
Matthew	40	22	37	He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’
Matthew	40	22	38	This is the greatest and first commandment.
Matthew	40	22	39	The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’
Matthew	40	22	40	On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”
Matthew	40	22	41	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them:
Matthew	40	22	42	“What do YOU think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David’s.”
Matthew	40	22	43	He said to them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration calls him ‘Lord,’ saying,
Matthew	40	22	44	‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’?
Matthew	40	22	45	If, therefore, David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”
Matthew	40	22	46	And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, nor did anyone dare from that day on to question him any further.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Matthew	40	23	1	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying:
Matthew	40	23	2	“The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses.
Matthew	40	23	3	Therefore all the things they tell YOU, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but do not perform.
Matthew	40	23	4	They bind up heavy loads and put them upon the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger.
Matthew	40	23	5	All the works they do they do to be viewed by men; for they broaden the scripture-containing cases that they wear as safeguards, and enlarge the fringes of their garments.
Matthew	40	23	6	They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues,
Matthew	40	23	7	and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men.
Matthew	40	23	8	But YOU, do not YOU be called Rabbi, for one is YOUR teacher, whereas all YOU are brothers.
Matthew	40	23	9	Moreover, do not call anyone YOUR father on earth, for one is YOUR Father, the heavenly One.
Matthew	40	23	10	Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for YOUR Leader is one, the Christ.
Matthew	40	23	11	But the greatest one among YOU must be YOUR minister.
Matthew	40	23	12	Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Matthew	40	23	13	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men; for YOU yourselves do not go in, neither do YOU permit those on their way in to go in.
Matthew	40	23	14	——
Matthew	40	23	15	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU traverse sea and dry land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one YOU make him a subject for Gehenna twice as much so as yourselves.
Matthew	40	23	16	“Woe to YOU, blind guides, who say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is under obligation.’
Matthew	40	23	17	Fools and blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold?
Matthew	40	23	18	Also, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is under obligation.’
Matthew	40	23	19	Blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Matthew	40	23	20	Therefore he that swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it;
Matthew	40	23	21	and he that swears by the temple is swearing by it and by him that is inhabiting it;
Matthew	40	23	22	and he that swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by him that is sitting on it.
Matthew	40	23	23	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but YOU have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was binding to do, yet not to disregard the other things.
Matthew	40	23	24	Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!
Matthew	40	23	25	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of plunder and immoderateness.
Matthew	40	23	26	Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside of it also may become clean.
Matthew	40	23	27	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every sort of uncleanness.
Matthew	40	23	28	In that way YOU also, outwardly indeed, appear righteous to men, but inside YOU are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Matthew	40	23	29	“Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU build the graves of the prophets and decorate the memorial tombs of the righteous ones,
Matthew	40	23	30	and YOU say, ‘If we were in the days of our forefathers, we would not be sharers with them in the blood of the prophets.’
Matthew	40	23	31	Therefore YOU are bearing witness against yourselves that YOU are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
Matthew	40	23	32	Well, then, fill up the measure of YOUR forefathers.
Matthew	40	23	33	“Serpents, offspring of vipers, how are YOU to flee from the judgment of Gehenna?
Matthew	40	23	34	For this reason, here I am sending forth to YOU prophets and wise men and public instructors. Some of them YOU will kill and impale, and some of them YOU will scourge in YOUR synagogues and persecute from city to city;
Matthew	40	23	35	that there may come upon YOU all the righteous blood spilled on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom YOU murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
Matthew	40	23	36	Truly I say to YOU, All these things will come upon this generation.
Matthew	40	23	37	“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her,—how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings! But YOU people did not want it.
Matthew	40	23	38	Look! YOUR house is abandoned to YOU.
Matthew	40	23	39	For I say to YOU, YOU will by no means see me from henceforth until YOU say, ‘Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name!’”

Matthew	40	24	1	Departing now, Jesus was on his way from the temple, but his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew	40	24	2	In response he said to them: “Do YOU not behold all these things? Truly I say to YOU, By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”
Matthew	40	24	3	While he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: “Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”
Matthew	40	24	4	And in answer Jesus said to them: “Look out that nobody misleads YOU;
Matthew	40	24	5	for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will mislead many.
Matthew	40	24	6	YOU are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that YOU are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
Matthew	40	24	7	“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.
Matthew	40	24	8	All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.
Matthew	40	24	9	“Then people will deliver YOU up to tribulation and will kill YOU, and YOU will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name.
Matthew	40	24	10	Then, also, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another.
Matthew	40	24	11	And many false prophets will arise and mislead many;
Matthew	40	24	12	and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.
Matthew	40	24	13	But he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.
Matthew	40	24	14	And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.
Matthew	40	24	15	“Therefore, when YOU catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place, (let the reader use discernment,)
Matthew	40	24	16	then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.
Matthew	40	24	17	Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house;
Matthew	40	24	18	and let the man in the field not return to the house to pick up his outer garment.
Matthew	40	24	19	Woe to the pregnant women and those suckling a baby in those days!
Matthew	40	24	20	Keep praying that YOUR flight may not occur in wintertime, nor on the sabbath day;
Matthew	40	24	21	for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.
Matthew	40	24	22	In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.
Matthew	40	24	23	“Then if anyone says to YOU, ‘Look! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There!’ do not believe it.
Matthew	40	24	24	For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.
Matthew	40	24	25	Look! I have forewarned YOU.
Matthew	40	24	26	Therefore, if people say to YOU, ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look! He is in the inner chambers,’ do not believe it.
Matthew	40	24	27	For just as the lightning comes out of eastern parts and shines over to western parts, so the presence of the Son of man will be.
Matthew	40	24	28	Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
Matthew	40	24	29	“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Matthew	40	24	30	And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew	40	24	31	And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.
Matthew	40	24	32	“Now learn from the fig tree as an illustration this point: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and it puts forth leaves, YOU know that summer is near.
Matthew	40	24	33	Likewise also YOU, when YOU see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.
Matthew	40	24	34	Truly I say to YOU that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.
Matthew	40	24	35	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
Matthew	40	24	36	“Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.
Matthew	40	24	37	For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.
Matthew	40	24	38	For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark;
Matthew	40	24	39	and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.
Matthew	40	24	40	Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken along and the other be abandoned;
Matthew	40	24	41	two women will be grinding at the hand mill: one will be taken along and the other be abandoned.
Matthew	40	24	42	Keep on the watch, therefore, because YOU do not know on what day YOUR Lord is coming.
Matthew	40	24	43	“But know one thing, that if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
Matthew	40	24	44	On this account YOU too prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that YOU do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.
Matthew	40	24	45	“Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?
Matthew	40	24	46	Happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so.
Matthew	40	24	47	Truly I say to YOU, He will appoint him over all his belongings.
Matthew	40	24	48	“But if ever that evil slave should say in his heart, ‘My master is delaying,’
Matthew	40	24	49	and should start to beat his fellow slaves and should eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards,
Matthew	40	24	50	the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know,
Matthew	40	24	51	and will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his part with the hypocrites. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.

Matthew	40	25	1	“Then the kingdom of the heavens will become like ten virgins that took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew	40	25	2	Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet.
Matthew	40	25	3	For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them,
Matthew	40	25	4	whereas the discreet took oil in their receptacles with their lamps.
Matthew	40	25	5	While the bridegroom was delaying, they all nodded and went to sleep.
Matthew	40	25	6	Right in the middle of the night there arose a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Be on YOUR way out to meet him.’
Matthew	40	25	7	Then all those virgins rose and put their lamps in order.
Matthew	40	25	8	The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of YOUR oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’
Matthew	40	25	9	The discreet answered with the words, ‘Perhaps there may not be quite enough for us and YOU. Be on YOUR way, instead, to those who sell it and buy for yourselves.’
Matthew	40	25	10	While they were going off to buy, the bridegroom arrived, and the virgins that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.
Matthew	40	25	11	Afterwards the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, sir, open to us!’
Matthew	40	25	12	In answer he said, ‘I tell YOU the truth, I do not know YOU.’
Matthew	40	25	13	“Keep on the watch, therefore, because YOU know neither the day nor the hour.
Matthew	40	25	14	“For it is just as when a man, about to travel abroad, summoned slaves of his and committed to them his belongings.
Matthew	40	25	15	And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to still another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went abroad.
Matthew	40	25	16	Immediately the one that received the five talents went his way and did business with them and gained five more.
Matthew	40	25	17	In the same way the one that received the two gained two more.
Matthew	40	25	18	But the one that received just one went off, and dug in the ground and hid the silver money of his master.
Matthew	40	25	19	“After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
Matthew	40	25	20	So the one that had received five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Master, you committed five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’
Matthew	40	25	21	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
Matthew	40	25	22	Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more.’
Matthew	40	25	23	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
Matthew	40	25	24	“Finally the one that had received the one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be an exacting man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.
Matthew	40	25	25	So I grew afraid and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’
Matthew	40	25	26	In reply his master said to him, ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow?
Matthew	40	25	27	Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what is mine with interest.
Matthew	40	25	28	“‘Therefore TAKE away the talent from him and give it to him that has the ten talents.
Matthew	40	25	29	For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Matthew	40	25	30	And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’
Matthew	40	25	31	“When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.
Matthew	40	25	32	And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
Matthew	40	25	33	And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
Matthew	40	25	34	“Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, YOU who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for YOU from the founding of the world.
Matthew	40	25	35	For I became hungry and YOU gave me something to eat; I got thirsty and YOU gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and YOU received me hospitably;
Matthew	40	25	36	naked, and YOU clothed me. I fell sick and YOU looked after me. I was in prison and YOU came to me.’
Matthew	40	25	37	Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink?
Matthew	40	25	38	When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked, and clothe you?
Matthew	40	25	39	When did we see you sick or in prison and go to you?’
Matthew	40	25	40	And in reply the king will say to them, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did it to one of the least of these my brothers, YOU did it to me.’
Matthew	40	25	41	“Then he will say, in turn, to those on his left, ‘Be on YOUR way from me, YOU who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
Matthew	40	25	42	For I became hungry, but YOU gave me nothing to eat, and I got thirsty, but YOU gave me nothing to drink.
Matthew	40	25	43	I was a stranger, but YOU did not receive me hospitably; naked, but YOU did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but YOU did not look after me.’
Matthew	40	25	44	Then they also will answer with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?’
Matthew	40	25	45	Then he will answer them with the words, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did not do it to one of these least ones, YOU did not do it to me.’
Matthew	40	25	46	And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”

Matthew	40	26	1	Now when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:
Matthew	40	26	2	“YOU know that two days from now the passover occurs, and the Son of man is to be delivered up to be impaled.”
Matthew	40	26	3	Then the chief priests and the older men of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,
Matthew	40	26	4	and took counsel together to seize Jesus by crafty device and kill him.
Matthew	40	26	5	However, they kept saying: “Not at the festival, in order that no uproar may arise among the people.”
Matthew	40	26	6	While Jesus happened to be in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew	40	26	7	a woman with an alabaster case of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it upon his head as he was reclining at the table.
Matthew	40	26	8	On seeing this the disciples became indignant and said: “Why this waste?
Matthew	40	26	9	For this could have been sold for a great deal and been given to poor people.”
Matthew	40	26	10	Aware of this, Jesus said to them: “Why do YOU try to make trouble for the woman? For she did a fine deed toward me.
Matthew	40	26	11	For YOU always have the poor with YOU, but YOU will not always have me.
Matthew	40	26	12	For when this woman put this perfumed oil upon my body, she did it for the preparation of me for burial.
Matthew	40	26	13	Truly I say to YOU, Wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did shall also be told as a remembrance of her.”
Matthew	40	26	14	Then one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
Matthew	40	26	15	and said: “What will YOU give me to betray him to YOU?” They stipulated to him thirty silver pieces.
Matthew	40	26	16	So from then on he kept seeking a good opportunity to betray him.
Matthew	40	26	17	On the first day of the unfermented cakes the disciples came up to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover?”
Matthew	40	26	18	He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, The Teacher says, ‘My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the passover with my disciples at your home.’”
Matthew	40	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus ordered them, and they got things ready for the passover.
Matthew	40	26	20	When, now, it had become evening, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
Matthew	40	26	21	While they were eating, he said: “Truly I say to YOU, One of YOU will betray me.”
Matthew	40	26	22	Being very much grieved at this, they commenced each and every one to say to him: “Lord, it is not I, is it?”
Matthew	40	26	23	In reply he said: “He that dips his hand with me in the bowl is the one that will betray me.
Matthew	40	26	24	True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been finer for him if that man had not been born.”
Matthew	40	26	25	By way of reply Judas, who was about to betray him, said: “It is not I, is it, Rabbi?” He said to him: “You yourself said it.”
Matthew	40	26	26	As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: “TAKE, eat. This means my body.”
Matthew	40	26	27	Also, he took a cup and, having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: “Drink out of it, all of YOU;
Matthew	40	26	28	for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.
Matthew	40	26	29	But I tell YOU, I will by no means drink henceforth any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with YOU in the kingdom of my Father.”
Matthew	40	26	30	Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew	40	26	31	Then Jesus said to them: “All of YOU will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.’
Matthew	40	26	32	But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of YOU into Galilee.”
Matthew	40	26	33	But Peter, in answer, said to him: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, never will I be stumbled!”
Matthew	40	26	34	Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you, On this night, before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.”
Matthew	40	26	35	Peter said to him: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” All the other disciples also said the same thing.
Matthew	40	26	36	Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples: “Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”
Matthew	40	26	37	And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he started to be grieved and to be sorely troubled.
Matthew	40	26	38	Then he said to them: “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.”
Matthew	40	26	39	And going a little way forward, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”
Matthew	40	26	40	And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: “Could YOU men not so much as watch one hour with me?
Matthew	40	26	41	Keep on the watch and pray continually, that YOU may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.”
Matthew	40	26	42	Again, for the second time, he went off and prayed, saying: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.”
Matthew	40	26	43	And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew	40	26	44	So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for the third time, saying once more the same word.
Matthew	40	26	45	Then he came to the disciples and said to them: “At such a time as this YOU are sleeping and taking YOUR rest! Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew	40	26	46	Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.”
Matthew	40	26	47	And while he was yet speaking, look! Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and older men of the people.
Matthew	40	26	48	Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying: “Whoever it is I kiss, this is he; take him into custody.”
Matthew	40	26	49	And going straight up to Jesus he said: “Good day, Rabbi!” and kissed him very tenderly.
Matthew	40	26	50	But Jesus said to him: “Fellow, for what purpose are you present?” Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus and took him into custody.
Matthew	40	26	51	But, look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.
Matthew	40	26	52	Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Matthew	40	26	53	Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew	40	26	54	In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must take place this way?”
Matthew	40	26	55	In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: “Have YOU come out with swords and clubs as against a robber to arrest me? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet YOU did not take me into custody.
Matthew	40	26	56	But all this has taken place for the scriptures of the prophets to be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.
Matthew	40	26	57	Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the older men were gathered together.
Matthew	40	26	58	But Peter kept following him at a good distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and, after going inside, he was sitting with the house attendants to see the outcome.
Matthew	40	26	59	Meantime the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus in order to put him to death,
Matthew	40	26	60	but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward. Later on two came forward
Matthew	40	26	61	and said: “This man said, ‘I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.’”
Matthew	40	26	62	With that the high priest stood up and said to him: “Have you no answer? What is it these are testifying against you?”
Matthew	40	26	63	But Jesus kept silent. So the high priest said to him: “By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!”
Matthew	40	26	64	Jesus said to him: “You yourself said it. Yet I say to YOU men, From henceforth YOU will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Matthew	40	26	65	Then the high priest ripped his outer garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now YOU have heard the blasphemy.
Matthew	40	26	66	What is YOUR opinion?” They returned answer: “He is liable to death.”
Matthew	40	26	67	Then they spit into his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him in the face,
Matthew	40	26	68	saying: “Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that struck you?”
Matthew	40	26	69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a servant girl came up to him, saying: “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean!”
Matthew	40	26	70	But he denied it before them all, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”
Matthew	40	26	71	After he had gone out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him and said to those there: “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”
Matthew	40	26	72	And again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man!”
Matthew	40	26	73	After a little while those standing around came up and said to Peter: “Certainly you also are one of them, for, in fact, your dialect gives you away.”
Matthew	40	26	74	Then he started to curse and swear: “I do not know the man!” And immediately a cock crowed.
Matthew	40	26	75	And Peter called to mind the saying Jesus spoke, namely: “Before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.

Matthew	40	27	1	When it had become morning, all the chief priests and the older men of the people held a consultation against Jesus so as to put him to death.
Matthew	40	27	2	And, after binding him, they led him off and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
Matthew	40	27	3	Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing he had been condemned, felt remorse and turned the thirty silver pieces back to the chief priests and older men,
Matthew	40	27	4	saying: “I sinned when I betrayed righteous blood.” They said: “What is that to us? You must see to that!”
Matthew	40	27	5	So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and withdrew, and went off and hanged himself.
Matthew	40	27	6	But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: “It is not lawful to drop them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.”
Matthew	40	27	7	After consulting together, they bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers.
Matthew	40	27	8	Therefore that field has been called “Field of Blood” to this very day.
Matthew	40	27	9	Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying: “And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price upon the man that was priced, the one on whom some of the sons of Israel set a price,
Matthew	40	27	10	and they gave them for the potter’s field, according to what Jehovah had commanded me.”
Matthew	40	27	11	Jesus now stood before the governor; and the governor put the question to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied: “You yourself say it.”
Matthew	40	27	12	But, while he was being accused by the chief priests and older men, he made no answer.
Matthew	40	27	13	Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
Matthew	40	27	14	Yet he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much.
Matthew	40	27	15	Now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, the one they wanted.
Matthew	40	27	16	Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
Matthew	40	27	17	Hence when they were gathered together Pilate said to them: “Which one do YOU want me to release to YOU, Barabbas or Jesus the so-called Christ?”
Matthew	40	27	18	For he was aware that out of envy they had handed him over.
Matthew	40	27	19	Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent out to him, saying: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him.”
Matthew	40	27	20	But the chief priests and the older men persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, but to have Jesus destroyed.
Matthew	40	27	21	Now in responding the governor said to them: “Which of the two do YOU want me to release to YOU?” They said: “Barabbas.”
Matthew	40	27	22	Pilate said to them: “What, then, shall I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?” They all said: “Let him be impaled!”
Matthew	40	27	23	He said: “Why, what bad thing did he do?” Still they kept crying out all the more: “Let him be impaled!”
Matthew	40	27	24	Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. YOU yourselves must see to it.”
Matthew	40	27	25	At that all the people said in answer: “His blood come upon us and upon our children.”
Matthew	40	27	26	Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be impaled.
Matthew	40	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace and gathered the whole body of troops together to him.
Matthew	40	27	28	And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak,
Matthew	40	27	29	and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand. And, kneeling before him, they made fun of him, saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!”
Matthew	40	27	30	And they spit upon him and took the reed and began hitting him upon his head.
Matthew	40	27	31	Finally, when they had made fun of him, they took the cloak off and put his outer garments upon him and led him off for impaling.
Matthew	40	27	32	As they were going out they found a native of Cyrene named Simon. This man they impressed into service to lift up his torture stake.
Matthew	40	27	33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Skull Place,
Matthew	40	27	34	they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink; but, after tasting it, he refused to drink.
Matthew	40	27	35	When they had impaled him they distributed his outer garments by casting lots,
Matthew	40	27	36	and, as they sat, they watched over him there.
Matthew	40	27	37	Also, they posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”
Matthew	40	27	38	Then two robbers were impaled with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Matthew	40	27	39	So the passersby began speaking abusively of him, wagging their heads
Matthew	40	27	40	and saying: “O you would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!”
Matthew	40	27	41	In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and older men began making fun of him and saying:
Matthew	40	27	42	“Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe on him.
Matthew	40	27	43	He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”
Matthew	40	27	44	In the same way even the robbers that were impaled together with him began reproaching him.
Matthew	40	27	45	From the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land, until the ninth hour.
Matthew	40	27	46	About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
Matthew	40	27	47	At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling Elijah.”
Matthew	40	27	48	And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed and went giving him a drink.
Matthew	40	27	49	But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.” Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out.
Matthew	40	27	50	Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew	40	27	51	And, look! the curtain of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rock-masses were split.
Matthew	40	27	52	And the memorial tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones that had fallen asleep were raised up,
Matthew	40	27	53	(and persons, coming out from among the memorial tombs after his being raised up, entered into the holy city,) and they became visible to many people.
Matthew	40	27	54	But the army officer and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things happening, grew very much afraid, saying: “Certainly this was God’s Son.”
Matthew	40	27	55	Moreover, many women were there viewing from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to minister to him;
Matthew	40	27	56	among whom was Mary Magdalene, also Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew	40	27	57	Now as it was late in the afternoon, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who had also himself become a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew	40	27	58	This man went up to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given over.
Matthew	40	27	59	And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen,
Matthew	40	27	60	and laid it in his new memorial tomb, which he had quarried in the rock-mass. And, after rolling a big stone to the door of the memorial tomb, he left.
Matthew	40	27	61	But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave.
Matthew	40	27	62	The next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate,
Matthew	40	27	63	saying: “Sir, we have called to mind that that impostor said while yet alive, ‘After three days I am to be raised up.’
Matthew	40	27	64	Therefore command the grave to be made secure until the third day, that his disciples may never come and steal him and say to the people, ‘He was raised up from the dead!’ and this last imposture will be worse than the first.”
Matthew	40	27	65	Pilate said to them: “YOU have a guard. Go make it as secure as YOU know how.”
Matthew	40	27	66	So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and having the guard.

Matthew	40	28	1	After the sabbath, when it was growing light on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the grave.
Matthew	40	28	2	And, notice! a great earthquake had taken place; for Jehovah’s angel had descended from heaven and approached and rolled away the stone, and was sitting on it.
Matthew	40	28	3	His outward appearance was as lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
Matthew	40	28	4	Yes, for fear of him the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.
Matthew	40	28	5	But the angel in answer said to the women: “Do not YOU be fearful, for I know YOU are looking for Jesus who was impaled.
Matthew	40	28	6	He is not here, for he was raised up, as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.
Matthew	40	28	7	And go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, and, look! he is going ahead of YOU into Galilee; there YOU will see him. Look! I have told YOU.”
Matthew	40	28	8	So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.
Matthew	40	28	9	And, look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and caught him by his feet and did obeisance to him.
Matthew	40	28	10	Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers, that they may go off into Galilee; and there they will see me.”
Matthew	40	28	11	While they were on their way, look! some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
Matthew	40	28	12	And after these had gathered together with the older men and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient number of silver pieces to the soldiers
Matthew	40	28	13	and said: “Say, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’
Matthew	40	28	14	And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and will set YOU free from worry.”
Matthew	40	28	15	So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed; and this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.
Matthew	40	28	16	However, the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them,
Matthew	40	28	17	and when they saw him they did obeisance, but some doubted.
Matthew	40	28	18	And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.
Matthew	40	28	19	Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,
Matthew	40	28	20	teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU. And, look! I am with YOU all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”

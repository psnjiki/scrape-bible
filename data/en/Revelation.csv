Revelation	66	1	1	A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him, to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. And he sent forth his angel and presented it in signs through him to his slave John,
Revelation	66	1	2	who bore witness to the word God gave and to the witness Jesus Christ gave, even to all the things he saw.
Revelation	66	1	3	Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written in it; for the appointed time is near.
Revelation	66	1	4	John to the seven congregations that are in the district of Asia: May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from “The One who is and who was and who is coming,” and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
Revelation	66	1	5	and from Jesus Christ, “the Faithful Witness,” “The firstborn from the dead,” and “The Ruler of the kings of the earth.” To him that loves us and that loosed us from our sins by means of his own blood—
Revelation	66	1	6	and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his God and Father—yes, to him be the glory and the might forever. Amen.
Revelation	66	1	7	Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him. Yes, Amen.
Revelation	66	1	8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says Jehovah God, “the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.”
Revelation	66	1	9	I John, YOUR brother and a sharer with YOU in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in company with Jesus, came to be in the isle that is called Patmos for speaking about God and bearing witness to Jesus.
Revelation	66	1	10	By inspiration I came to be in the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a strong voice like that of a trumpet,
Revelation	66	1	11	saying: “What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven congregations, in Ephesus and in Smyrna and in Pergamum and in Thyatira and in Sardis and in Philadelphia and in Laodicea.”
Revelation	66	1	12	And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me, and, having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
Revelation	66	1	13	and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man, clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation	66	1	14	Moreover, his head and his hair were white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a fiery flame;
Revelation	66	1	15	and his feet were like fine copper when glowing in a furnace; and his voice was as the sound of many waters.
Revelation	66	1	16	And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth a sharp, long two-edged sword was protruding, and his countenance was as the sun when it shines in its power.
Revelation	66	1	17	And when I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. And he laid his right hand upon me and said: “Do not be fearful. I am the First and the Last,
Revelation	66	1	18	and the living one; and I became dead, but, look! I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Revelation	66	1	19	Therefore write down the things you saw, and the things that are and the things that will take place after these.
Revelation	66	1	20	As for the sacred secret of the seven stars that you saw upon my right hand, and of the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars mean the angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands mean seven congregations.

Revelation	66	2	1	“To the angel of the congregation in Ephesus write: These are the things that he says who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands,
Revelation	66	2	2	‘I know your deeds, and your labor and endurance, and that you cannot bear bad men, and that you put those to the test who say they are apostles, but they are not, and you found them liars.
Revelation	66	2	3	You are also showing endurance, and you have borne up for my name’s sake and have not grown weary.
Revelation	66	2	4	Nevertheless, I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.
Revelation	66	2	5	“‘Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent and do the former deeds. If you do not, I am coming to you, and I will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
Revelation	66	2	6	Still, you do have this, that you hate the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus, which I also hate.
Revelation	66	2	7	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: To him that conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’
Revelation	66	2	8	“And to the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write: These are the things that he says, ‘the First and the Last,’ who became dead and came to life again,
Revelation	66	2	9	‘I know your tribulation and poverty—but you are rich—and the blasphemy by those who say they themselves are Jews, and yet they are not but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation	66	2	10	Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of YOU into prison that YOU may be fully put to the test, and that YOU may have tribulation ten days. Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.
Revelation	66	2	11	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: He that conquers will by no means be harmed by the second death.’
Revelation	66	2	12	“And to the angel of the congregation in Pergamum write: These are the things that he says who has the sharp, long two-edged sword,
Revelation	66	2	13	‘I know where you are dwelling, that is, where the throne of Satan is; and yet you keep on holding fast my name, and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of Antipas, my witness, the faithful one, who was killed by YOUR side, where Satan is dwelling.
Revelation	66	2	14	“‘Nevertheless, I have a few things against you, that you have there those holding fast the teaching of Balaam, who went teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.
Revelation	66	2	15	So you, also, have those holding fast the teaching of the sect of Nicolaus likewise.
Revelation	66	2	16	Therefore repent. If you do not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will war with them with the long sword of my mouth.
Revelation	66	2	17	“‘Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: To him that conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white pebble, and upon the pebble a new name written which no one knows except the one receiving it.’
Revelation	66	2	18	“And to the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write: These are the things that the Son of God says, he who has his eyes like a fiery flame, and his feet are like fine copper,
Revelation	66	2	19	‘I know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those formerly.
Revelation	66	2	20	“‘Nevertheless, I do hold this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and misleads my slaves to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
Revelation	66	2	21	And I gave her time to repent, but she is not willing to repent of her fornication.
Revelation	66	2	22	Look! I am about to throw her into a sickbed, and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.
Revelation	66	2	23	And her children I will kill with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the kidneys and hearts, and I will give to YOU individually according to YOUR deeds.
Revelation	66	2	24	“‘However, I say to the rest of YOU who are in Thyatira, all those who do not have this teaching, the very ones who did not get to know the “deep things of Satan,” as they say: I am not putting upon YOU any other burden.
Revelation	66	2	25	Just the same, hold fast what YOU have until I come.
Revelation	66	2	26	And to him that conquers and observes my deeds down to the end I will give authority over the nations,
Revelation	66	2	27	and he shall shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, the same as I have received from my Father,
Revelation	66	2	28	and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation	66	2	29	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’

Revelation	66	3	1	“And to the angel of the congregation in Sardis write: These are the things that he says who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars, ‘I know your deeds, that you have the name that you are alive, but you are dead.
Revelation	66	3	2	Become watchful, and strengthen the things remaining that were ready to die, for I have not found your deeds fully performed before my God.
Revelation	66	3	3	Therefore, continue mindful of how you have received and how you heard, and go on keeping it, and repent. Certainly unless you wake up, I shall come as a thief, and you will not know at all at what hour I shall come upon you.
Revelation	66	3	4	“‘Nevertheless, you do have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their outer garments, and they shall walk with me in white ones, because they are worthy.
Revelation	66	3	5	He that conquers will thus be arrayed in white outer garments; and I will by no means blot out his name from the book of life, but I will make acknowledgment of his name before my Father and before his angels.
Revelation	66	3	6	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’
Revelation	66	3	7	“And to the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write: These are the things he says who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens so that no one will shut, and shuts so that no one opens,
Revelation	66	3	8	‘I know your deeds—look! I have set before you an opened door, which no one can shut—that you have a little power, and you kept my word and did not prove false to my name.
Revelation	66	3	9	Look! I will give those from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and yet they are not but are lying—look! I will make them come and do obeisance before your feet and make them know I have loved you.
Revelation	66	3	10	Because you kept the word about my endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of test, which is to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to put a test upon those dwelling on the earth.
Revelation	66	3	11	I am coming quickly. Keep on holding fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.
Revelation	66	3	12	“‘The one that conquers—I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will by no means go out from it anymore, and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which descends out of heaven from my God, and that new name of mine.
Revelation	66	3	13	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’
Revelation	66	3	14	“And to the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write: These are the things that the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God,
Revelation	66	3	15	‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or else hot.
Revelation	66	3	16	So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.
Revelation	66	3	17	Because you say: “I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,” but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked,
Revelation	66	3	18	I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire that you may become rich, and white outer garments that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not become manifested, and eyesalve to rub in your eyes that you may see.
Revelation	66	3	19	“‘All those for whom I have affection I reprove and discipline. Therefore be zealous and repent.
Revelation	66	3	20	Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into his house and take the evening meal with him and he with me.
Revelation	66	3	21	To the one that conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, even as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.
Revelation	66	3	22	Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’”

Revelation	66	4	1	After these things I saw, and, look! an opened door in heaven, and the first voice that I heard was as of a trumpet, speaking with me, saying: “Come on up here, and I shall show you the things that must take place.”
Revelation	66	4	2	After these things I immediately came to be in the power of the spirit: and, look! a throne was in its position in heaven, and there is one seated upon the throne.
Revelation	66	4	3	And the one seated is, in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone, and round about the throne there is a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.
Revelation	66	4	4	And round about the throne there are twenty-four thrones, and upon these thrones I saw seated twenty-four elders dressed in white outer garments, and upon their heads golden crowns.
Revelation	66	4	5	And out of the throne there are proceeding lightnings and voices and thunders; and there are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of God.
Revelation	66	4	6	And before the throne there is, as it were, a glassy sea like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne there are four living creatures that are full of eyes in front and behind.
Revelation	66	4	7	And the first living creature is like a lion, and the second living creature is like a young bull, and the third living creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature is like a flying eagle.
Revelation	66	4	8	And as for the four living creatures, each one of them respectively has six wings; round about and underneath they are full of eyes. And they have no rest day and night as they say: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.”
Revelation	66	4	9	And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to the one seated upon the throne, the one that lives forever and ever,
Revelation	66	4	10	the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated upon the throne and worship the One that lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
Revelation	66	4	11	“You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.”

Revelation	66	5	1	And I saw in the right hand of the One seated upon the throne a scroll written within and on the reverse side, sealed tight with seven seals.
Revelation	66	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and loose its seals?”
Revelation	66	5	3	But neither in heaven nor upon earth nor underneath the earth was there a single one able to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation	66	5	4	And I gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation	66	5	5	But one of the elders says to me: “Stop weeping. Look! The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
Revelation	66	5	6	And I saw standing in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a lamb as though it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which eyes mean the seven spirits of God that have been sent forth into the whole earth.
Revelation	66	5	7	And he went and at once took it out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne.
Revelation	66	5	8	And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense, and the incense means the prayers of the holy ones.
Revelation	66	5	9	And they sing a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
Revelation	66	5	10	and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.”
Revelation	66	5	11	And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
Revelation	66	5	12	saying with a loud voice: “The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”
Revelation	66	5	13	And every creature that is in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth and on the sea, and all the things in them, I heard saying: “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.”
Revelation	66	5	14	And the four living creatures went saying: “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.

Revelation	66	6	1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice as of thunder: “Come!”
Revelation	66	6	2	And I saw, and, look! a white horse; and the one seated upon it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest.
Revelation	66	6	3	And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come!”
Revelation	66	6	4	And another came forth, a fiery-colored horse; and to the one seated upon it there was granted to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another; and a great sword was given him.
Revelation	66	6	5	And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come!” And I saw, and, look! a black horse; and the one seated upon it had a pair of scales in his hand.
Revelation	66	6	6	And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.”
Revelation	66	6	7	And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come!”
Revelation	66	6	8	And I saw, and, look! a pale horse; and the one seated upon it had the name Death. And Hades was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation	66	6	9	And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the witness work that they used to have.
Revelation	66	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying: “Until when, Sovereign Lord holy and true, are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?”
Revelation	66	6	11	And a white robe was given to each of them; and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number was filled also of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they also had been.
Revelation	66	6	12	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the entire moon became as blood,
Revelation	66	6	13	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind casts its unripe figs.
Revelation	66	6	14	And the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and every island were removed from their places.
Revelation	66	6	15	And the kings of the earth and the top-ranking ones and the military commanders and the rich and the strong ones and every slave and every free person hid themselves in the caves and in the rock-masses of the mountains.
Revelation	66	6	16	And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rock-masses: “Fall over us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
Revelation	66	6	17	because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”

Revelation	66	7	1	After this I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding tight the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth or upon the sea or upon any tree.
Revelation	66	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrising, having a seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,
Revelation	66	7	3	saying: “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until after we have sealed the slaves of our God in their foreheads.”
Revelation	66	7	4	And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:
Revelation	66	7	5	Out of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed;out of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;
Revelation	66	7	6	out of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;
Revelation	66	7	7	out of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;
Revelation	66	7	8	out of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand;out of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed.
Revelation	66	7	9	After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands.
Revelation	66	7	10	And they keep on crying with a loud voice, saying: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.”
Revelation	66	7	11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
Revelation	66	7	12	saying: “Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”
Revelation	66	7	13	And in response one of the elders said to me: “These who are dressed in the white robes, who are they and where did they come from?”
Revelation	66	7	14	So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one that knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation	66	7	15	That is why they are before the throne of God; and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them.
Revelation	66	7	16	They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down upon them nor any scorching heat,
Revelation	66	7	17	because the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne, will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.”

Revelation	66	8	1	And when he opened the seventh seal, a silence occurred in heaven for about a half hour.
Revelation	66	8	2	And I saw the seven angels that stand before God, and seven trumpets were given them.
Revelation	66	8	3	And another angel arrived and stood at the altar, having a golden incense vessel; and a large quantity of incense was given him to offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar that was before the throne.
Revelation	66	8	4	And the smoke of the incense ascended from the hand of the angel with the prayers of the holy ones before God.
Revelation	66	8	5	But right away the angel took the incense vessel, and he filled it with some of the fire of the altar and hurled it to the earth. And thunders occurred and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.
Revelation	66	8	6	And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
Revelation	66	8	7	And the first one blew his trumpet. And there occurred a hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees was burned up, and all the green vegetation was burned up.
Revelation	66	8	8	And the second angel blew his trumpet. And something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. And a third of the sea became blood;
Revelation	66	8	9	and a third of the creatures that are in the sea which have souls died, and a third of the boats were wrecked.
Revelation	66	8	10	And the third angel blew his trumpet. And a great star burning as a lamp fell from heaven, and it fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters.
Revelation	66	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters, because these had been made bitter.
Revelation	66	8	12	And the fourth angel blew his trumpet. And a third of the sun was smitten and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not have illumination for a third of it, and the night likewise.
Revelation	66	8	13	And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: “Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Revelation	66	9	1	And the fifth angel blew his trumpet. And I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key of the pit of the abyss was given him.
Revelation	66	9	2	And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened, also the air, by the smoke of the pit.
Revelation	66	9	3	And out of the smoke locusts came forth upon the earth; and authority was given them, the same authority as the scorpions of the earth have.
Revelation	66	9	4	And they were told to harm no vegetation of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation	66	9	5	And it was granted the locusts, not to kill them, but that these should be tormented five months, and the torment upon them was as torment by a scorpion when it strikes a man.
Revelation	66	9	6	And in those days the men will seek death but will by no means find it, and they will desire to die but death keeps fleeing from them.
Revelation	66	9	7	And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads were what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces were as men’s faces,
Revelation	66	9	8	but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions;
Revelation	66	9	9	and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.
Revelation	66	9	10	Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.
Revelation	66	9	11	They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
Revelation	66	9	12	The one woe is past. Look! Two more woes are coming after these things.
Revelation	66	9	13	And the sixth angel blew his trumpet. And I heard one voice out of the horns of the golden altar that is before God
Revelation	66	9	14	say to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet: “Untie the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
Revelation	66	9	15	And the four angels were untied, who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, to kill a third of the men.
Revelation	66	9	16	And the number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.
Revelation	66	9	17	And this is how I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them: they had fire-red and hyacinth-blue and sulphur-yellow breastplates; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths fire and smoke and sulphur issued forth.
Revelation	66	9	18	By these three plagues a third of the men were killed, from the fire and the smoke and the sulphur which issued forth from their mouths.
Revelation	66	9	19	For the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with these they do harm.
Revelation	66	9	20	But the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they should not worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;
Revelation	66	9	21	and they did not repent of their murders nor of their spiritistic practices nor of their fornication nor of their thefts.

Revelation	66	10	1	And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet were as fiery pillars,
Revelation	66	10	2	and he had in his hand a little scroll opened. And he set his right foot upon the sea, but his left one upon the earth,
Revelation	66	10	3	and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.
Revelation	66	10	4	Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was at the point of writing; but I heard a voice out of heaven say: “Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.”
Revelation	66	10	5	And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven,
Revelation	66	10	6	and by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it, he swore: “There will be no delay any longer;
Revelation	66	10	7	but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.”
Revelation	66	10	8	And the voice that I heard out of heaven is speaking again with me and saying: “Go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.”
Revelation	66	10	9	And I went away to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me: “Take it and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”
Revelation	66	10	10	And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it up, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; but when I had eaten it up, my belly was made bitter.
Revelation	66	10	11	And they say to me: “You must prophesy again with regard to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.”

Revelation	66	11	1	And a reed like a rod was given me as he said: “Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it.
Revelation	66	11	2	But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.
Revelation	66	11	3	And I will cause my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days dressed in sackcloth.”
Revelation	66	11	4	These are symbolized by the two olive trees and the two lampstands and are standing before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation	66	11	5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire issues forth from their mouths and devours their enemies; and if anyone should want to harm them, in this manner he must be killed.
Revelation	66	11	6	These have the authority to shut up heaven that no rain should fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish.
Revelation	66	11	7	And when they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them.
Revelation	66	11	8	And their corpses will be on the broad way of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also impaled.
Revelation	66	11	9	And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not let their corpses be laid in a tomb.
Revelation	66	11	10	And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and enjoy themselves, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.
Revelation	66	11	11	And after the three and a half days spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them.
Revelation	66	11	12	And they heard a loud voice out of heaven say to them: “Come on up here.” And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.
Revelation	66	11	13	And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and a tenth of the city fell; and seven thousand persons were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation	66	11	14	The second woe is past. Look! The third woe is coming quickly.
Revelation	66	11	15	And the seventh angel blew his trumpet. And loud voices occurred in heaven, saying: “The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.”
Revelation	66	11	16	And the twenty-four elders who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces and worshiped God,
Revelation	66	11	17	saying: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.
Revelation	66	11	18	But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”
Revelation	66	11	19	And the temple sanctuary of God that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary. And there occurred lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail.

Revelation	66	12	1	And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars,
Revelation	66	12	2	and she was pregnant. And she cries out in her pains and in her agony to give birth.
Revelation	66	12	3	And another sign was seen in heaven, and, look! a great fiery-colored dragon, with seven heads and ten horns and upon its heads seven diadems;
Revelation	66	12	4	and its tail drags a third of the stars of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth. And the dragon kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth, that, when she did give birth, it might devour her child.
Revelation	66	12	5	And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne.
Revelation	66	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
Revelation	66	12	7	And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled
Revelation	66	12	8	but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven.
Revelation	66	12	9	So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.
Revelation	66	12	10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God!
Revelation	66	12	11	And they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing, and they did not love their souls even in the face of death.
Revelation	66	12	12	On this account be glad, YOU heavens and YOU who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to YOU, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”
Revelation	66	12	13	Now when the dragon saw that it was hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the woman that gave birth to the male child.
Revelation	66	12	14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place; there is where she is fed for a time and times and half a time away from the face of the serpent.
Revelation	66	12	15	And the serpent disgorged water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river.
Revelation	66	12	16	But the earth came to the woman’s help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon disgorged from its mouth.
Revelation	66	12	17	And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.

Revelation	66	13	1	And it stood still upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and upon its horns ten diadems, but upon its heads blasphemous names.
Revelation	66	13	2	Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were as those of a bear, and its mouth was as a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.
Revelation	66	13	3	And I saw one of its heads as though slaughtered to death, but its death-stroke got healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration.
Revelation	66	13	4	And they worshiped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshiped the wild beast with the words: “Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?”
Revelation	66	13	5	And a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given it, and authority to act forty-two months was given it.
Revelation	66	13	6	And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his residence, even those residing in heaven.
Revelation	66	13	7	And there was granted it to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
Revelation	66	13	8	And all those who dwell on the earth will worship it; the name of not one of them stands written in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered, from the founding of the world.
Revelation	66	13	9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
Revelation	66	13	10	If anyone is meant for captivity, he goes away into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is where it means the endurance and faith of the holy ones.
Revelation	66	13	11	And I saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking as a dragon.
Revelation	66	13	12	And it exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight. And it makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first wild beast, whose death-stroke got healed.
Revelation	66	13	13	And it performs great signs, so that it should even make fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind.
Revelation	66	13	14	And it misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that were granted it to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived.
Revelation	66	13	15	And there was granted it to give breath to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who would not in any way worship the image of the wild beast.
Revelation	66	13	16	And it puts under compulsion all persons, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that they should give these a mark in their right hand or upon their forehead,
Revelation	66	13	17	and that nobody might be able to buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.
Revelation	66	13	18	Here is where wisdom comes in: Let the one that has intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number; and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.

Revelation	66	14	1	And I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
Revelation	66	14	2	And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.
Revelation	66	14	3	And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to master that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought from the earth.
Revelation	66	14	4	These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,
Revelation	66	14	5	and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.
Revelation	66	14	6	And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
Revelation	66	14	7	saying in a loud voice: “FEAR God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.”
Revelation	66	14	8	And another, a second angel, followed, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the anger of her fornication!”
Revelation	66	14	9	And another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand,
Revelation	66	14	10	he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.
Revelation	66	14	11	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.
Revelation	66	14	12	Here is where it means endurance for the holy ones, those who observe the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”
Revelation	66	14	13	And I heard a voice out of heaven say: “Write: Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right with them.”
Revelation	66	14	14	And I saw, and, look! a white cloud, and upon the cloud someone seated like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
Revelation	66	14	15	And another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary, crying with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: “Put your sickle in and reap, because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is thoroughly ripe.”
Revelation	66	14	16	And the one seated on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Revelation	66	14	17	And still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven, he, too, having a sharp sickle.
Revelation	66	14	18	And still another angel emerged from the altar and he had authority over the fire. And he called out with a loud voice to the one that had the sharp sickle, saying: “Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because its grapes have become ripe.”
Revelation	66	14	19	And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of the anger of God.
Revelation	66	14	20	And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses, for a distance of a thousand six hundred furlongs.

Revelation	66	15	1	And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.
Revelation	66	15	2	And I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea mingled with fire, and those who come off victorious from the wild beast and from its image and from the number of its name standing by the glassy sea, having harps of God.
Revelation	66	15	3	And they are singing the song of Moses the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity.
Revelation	66	15	4	Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been made manifest.”
Revelation	66	15	5	And after these things I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven,
Revelation	66	15	6	and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and girded about their breasts with golden girdles.
Revelation	66	15	7	And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.
Revelation	66	15	8	And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God and because of his power, and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Revelation	66	16	1	And I heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary say to the seven angels: “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of God into the earth.”
Revelation	66	16	2	And the first one went off and poured out his bowl into the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer came to be upon the men that had the mark of the wild beast and that were worshiping its image.
Revelation	66	16	3	And the second one poured out his bowl into the sea. And it became blood as of a dead man, and every living soul died, yes, the things in the sea.
Revelation	66	16	4	And the third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters. And they became blood.
Revelation	66	16	5	And I heard the angel over the waters say: “You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, because you have rendered these decisions,
Revelation	66	16	6	because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.”
Revelation	66	16	7	And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Jehovah God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judicial decisions.”
Revelation	66	16	8	And the fourth one poured out his bowl upon the sun; and to the sun it was granted to scorch the men with fire.
Revelation	66	16	9	And the men were scorched with great heat, but they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give glory to him.
Revelation	66	16	10	And the fifth one poured out his bowl upon the throne of the wild beast. And its kingdom became darkened, and they began to gnaw their tongues for their pain,
Revelation	66	16	11	but they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.
Revelation	66	16	12	And the sixth one poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.
Revelation	66	16	13	And I saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
Revelation	66	16	14	They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.
Revelation	66	16	15	“Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.”
Revelation	66	16	16	And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Har–Magedon.
Revelation	66	16	17	And the seventh one poured out his bowl upon the air. At this a loud voice issued out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying: “It has come to pass!”
Revelation	66	16	18	And lightnings and voices and thunders occurred, and a great earthquake occurred such as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive an earthquake, so great.
Revelation	66	16	19	And the great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the Great was remembered in the sight of God, to give her the cup of the wine of the anger of his wrath.
Revelation	66	16	20	Also, every island fled, and mountains were not found.
Revelation	66	16	21	And a great hail with every stone about the weight of a talent descended out of heaven upon the men, and the men blasphemed God due to the plague of hail, because the plague of it was unusually great.

Revelation	66	17	1	And one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: “Come, I will show you the judgment upon the great harlot who sits on many waters,
Revelation	66	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, whereas those who inhabit the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”
Revelation	66	17	3	And he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. And I caught sight of a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation	66	17	4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and was adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls and had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her fornication.
Revelation	66	17	5	And upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.”
Revelation	66	17	6	And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. Well, on catching sight of her I wondered with great wonderment.
Revelation	66	17	7	And so the angel said to me: “Why is it you wondered? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns:
Revelation	66	17	8	The wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss, and it is to go off into destruction. And when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present, those who dwell on the earth will wonder admiringly, but their names have not been written upon the scroll of life from the founding of the world.
Revelation	66	17	9	“Here is where the intelligence that has wisdom comes in: The seven heads mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top.
Revelation	66	17	10	And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet arrived, but when he does arrive he must remain a short while.
Revelation	66	17	11	And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also itself an eighth king, but springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction.
Revelation	66	17	12	“And the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast.
Revelation	66	17	13	These have one thought, and so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.
Revelation	66	17	14	These will battle with the Lamb, but, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those called and chosen and faithful with him will do so.”
Revelation	66	17	15	And he says to me: “The waters that you saw, where the harlot is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.
Revelation	66	17	16	And the ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire.
Revelation	66	17	17	For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought, even to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, until the words of God will have been accomplished.
Revelation	66	17	18	And the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.”

Revelation	66	18	1	After these things I saw another angel descending from heaven, with great authority; and the earth was lighted up from his glory.
Revelation	66	18	2	And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a lurking place of every unclean exhalation and a lurking place of every unclean and hated bird!
Revelation	66	18	3	For because of the wine of the anger of her fornication all the nations have fallen victim, and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the traveling merchants of the earth became rich due to the power of her shameless luxury.”
Revelation	66	18	4	And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if YOU do not want to share with her in her sins, and if YOU do not want to receive part of her plagues.
Revelation	66	18	5	For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.
Revelation	66	18	6	Render to her even as she herself rendered, and do to her twice as much, yes, twice the number of the things she did; in the cup in which she put a mixture put twice as much of the mixture for her.
Revelation	66	18	7	To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.’
Revelation	66	18	8	That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.
Revelation	66	18	9	“And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her, when they look at the smoke from the burning of her,
Revelation	66	18	10	while they stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say, ‘Too bad, too bad, you great city, Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’
Revelation	66	18	11	“Also, the traveling merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full stock anymore,
Revelation	66	18	12	a full stock of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet; and everything in scented wood and every sort of ivory object and every sort of object out of most precious wood and of copper and of iron and of marble;
Revelation	66	18	13	also cinnamon and Indian spice and incense and perfumed oil and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and horses and coaches and slaves and human souls.
Revelation	66	18	14	Yes, the fine fruit that your soul desired has departed from you, and all the dainty things and the gorgeous things have perished from you, and never again will people find them.
Revelation	66	18	15	“The traveling merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn,
Revelation	66	18	16	saying, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet, and richly adorned with gold ornament and precious stone and pearl,
Revelation	66	18	17	because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’ “And every ship captain and every man that voyages anywhere, and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea, stood at a distance
Revelation	66	18	18	and cried out as they looked at the smoke from the burning of her and said, ‘What city is like the great city?’
Revelation	66	18	19	And they threw dust upon their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, in which all those having boats at sea became rich by reason of her costliness, because in one hour she has been devastated!’
Revelation	66	18	20	“Be glad over her, O heaven, also YOU holy ones and YOU apostles and YOU prophets, because God has judicially exacted punishment for YOU from her!”
Revelation	66	18	21	And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.
Revelation	66	18	22	And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp and of musicians and of flutists and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again, and no craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again,
Revelation	66	18	23	and no light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; because your traveling merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, for by your spiritistic practice all the nations were misled.
Revelation	66	18	24	Yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”

Revelation	66	19	1	After these things I heard what was as a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah, YOU people! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,
Revelation	66	19	2	because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment upon the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves at her hand.”
Revelation	66	19	3	And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah, YOU people! And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.”
Revelation	66	19	4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God seated upon the throne, and said: “Amen! Praise Jah, YOU people!”
Revelation	66	19	5	Also, a voice issued forth from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all YOU his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.”
Revelation	66	19	6	And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, YOU people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.
Revelation	66	19	7	Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.
Revelation	66	19	8	Yes, it has been granted to her to be arrayed in bright, clean, fine linen, for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”
Revelation	66	19	9	And he tells me: “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.”
Revelation	66	19	10	At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus. Worship God; for the bearing witness to Jesus is what inspires prophesying.”
Revelation	66	19	11	And I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.
Revelation	66	19	12	His eyes are a fiery flame, and upon his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,
Revelation	66	19	13	and he is arrayed with an outer garment sprinkled with blood, and the name he is called is The Word of God.
Revelation	66	19	14	Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.
Revelation	66	19	15	And out of his mouth there protrudes a sharp long sword, that he may strike the nations with it, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. He treads too the winepress of the anger of the wrath of God the Almighty.
Revelation	66	19	16	And upon his outer garment, even upon his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.
Revelation	66	19	17	I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God,
Revelation	66	19	18	that YOU may eat the fleshy parts of kings and the fleshy parts of military commanders and the fleshy parts of strong men and the fleshy parts of horses and of those seated upon them, and the fleshy parts of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.”
Revelation	66	19	19	And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage the war with the one seated on the horse and with his army.
Revelation	66	19	20	And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who render worship to its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulphur.
Revelation	66	19	21	But the rest were killed off with the long sword of the one seated on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth. And all the birds were filled from the fleshy parts of them.

Revelation	66	20	1	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation	66	20	2	And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
Revelation	66	20	3	And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not mislead the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.
Revelation	66	20	4	And I saw thrones, and there were those who sat down on them, and power of judging was given them. Yes, I saw the souls of those executed with the ax for the witness they bore to Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had worshiped neither the wild beast nor its image and who had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand. And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years.
Revelation	66	20	5	(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
Revelation	66	20	6	Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years.
Revelation	66	20	7	Now as soon as the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison,
Revelation	66	20	8	and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea.
Revelation	66	20	9	And they advanced over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and devoured them.
Revelation	66	20	10	And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
Revelation	66	20	11	And I saw a great white throne and the one seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
Revelation	66	20	12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.
Revelation	66	20	13	And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.
Revelation	66	20	14	And death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.
Revelation	66	20	15	Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.

Revelation	66	21	1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.
Revelation	66	21	2	I saw also the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation	66	21	3	With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them.
Revelation	66	21	4	And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”
Revelation	66	21	5	And the One seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new.” Also, he says: “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”
Revelation	66	21	6	And he said to me: “They have come to pass! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To anyone thirsting I will give from the fountain of the water of life free.
Revelation	66	21	7	Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God and he will be my son.
Revelation	66	21	8	But as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and fornicators and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur. This means the second death.”
Revelation	66	21	9	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls which were full of the seven last plagues, and he spoke with me and said: “Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”
Revelation	66	21	10	So he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God
Revelation	66	21	11	and having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone shining crystal-clear.
Revelation	66	21	12	It had a great and lofty wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
Revelation	66	21	13	On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
Revelation	66	21	14	The wall of the city also had twelve foundation stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation	66	21	15	Now the one who was speaking with me was holding as a measure a golden reed, that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.
Revelation	66	21	16	And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; its length and breadth and height are equal.
Revelation	66	21	17	Also, he measured its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s.
Revelation	66	21	18	Now the structure of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.
Revelation	66	21	19	The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
Revelation	66	21	20	the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
Revelation	66	21	21	Also, the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. And the broad way of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.
Revelation	66	21	22	And I did not see a temple in it, for Jehovah God the Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb is.
Revelation	66	21	23	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God lighted it up, and its lamp was the Lamb.
Revelation	66	21	24	And the nations will walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
Revelation	66	21	25	And its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there.
Revelation	66	21	26	And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
Revelation	66	21	27	But anything not sacred and anyone that carries on a disgusting thing and a lie will in no way enter into it; only those written in the Lamb’s scroll of life will.

Revelation	66	22	1	And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb
Revelation	66	22	2	down the middle of its broad way. And on this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life producing twelve crops of fruit, yielding their fruits each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations.
Revelation	66	22	3	And no more will there be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will render him sacred service;
Revelation	66	22	4	and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
Revelation	66	22	5	Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamplight nor do they have sunlight, because Jehovah God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever.
Revelation	66	22	6	And he said to me: “These words are faithful and true; yes, Jehovah the God of the inspired expressions of the prophets sent his angel forth to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place.
Revelation	66	22	7	And, look! I am coming quickly. Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.”
Revelation	66	22	8	Well, I John was the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that had been showing me these things.
Revelation	66	22	9	But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who are prophets and of those who are observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.”
Revelation	66	22	10	He also tells me: “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near.
Revelation	66	22	11	He that is doing unrighteousness, let him do unrighteousness still; and let the filthy one be made filthy still; but let the righteous one do righteousness still, and let the holy one be made holy still.
Revelation	66	22	12	“‘Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to render to each one as his work is.
Revelation	66	22	13	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
Revelation	66	22	14	Happy are those who wash their robes, that the authority to go to the trees of life may be theirs and that they may gain entrance into the city by its gates.
Revelation	66	22	15	Outside are the dogs and those who practice spiritism and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone liking and carrying on a lie.’
Revelation	66	22	16	“‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to YOU people of these things for the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.’”
Revelation	66	22	17	And the spirit and the bride keep on saying: “Come!” And let anyone hearing say: “Come!” And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.
Revelation	66	22	18	“I am bearing witness to everyone that hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll;
Revelation	66	22	19	and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take his portion away from the trees of life and out of the holy city, things which are written about in this scroll.
Revelation	66	22	20	“He that bears witness of these things says, ‘Yes; I am coming quickly.’” “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.”
Revelation	66	22	21	May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the holy ones.

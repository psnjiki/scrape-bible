2 John	63	1	1	The older man to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I truly love, and not I alone, but all those also who have come to know the truth,
2 John	63	1	2	because of the truth that remains in us, and it will be with us forever.
2 John	63	1	3	There will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, with truth and love.
2 John	63	1	4	I rejoice very much because I have found certain ones of your children walking in the truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.
2 John	63	1	5	So now I request you, lady, as a person writing you, not a new commandment, but one which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
2 John	63	1	6	And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as YOU people have heard from the beginning, that YOU should go on walking in it.
2 John	63	1	7	For many deceivers have gone forth into the world, persons not confessing Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
2 John	63	1	8	Look out for yourselves, that YOU do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that YOU may obtain a full reward.
2 John	63	1	9	Everyone that pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. He that does remain in this teaching is the one that has both the Father and the Son.
2 John	63	1	10	If anyone comes to YOU and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into YOUR homes or say a greeting to him.
2 John	63	1	11	For he that says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.
2 John	63	1	12	Although I have many things to write YOU, I do not desire to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to YOU and to speak with YOU face to face, that YOUR joy may be in full measure.
2 John	63	1	13	The children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings.

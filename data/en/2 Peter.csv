2 Peter	61	1	1	Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith, held in equal privilege with ours, by the righteousness of our God and the Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Peter	61	1	2	May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to YOU by an accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
2 Peter	61	1	3	forasmuch as his divine power has given us freely all the things that concern life and godly devotion, through the accurate knowledge of the one who called us through glory and virtue.
2 Peter	61	1	4	Through these things he has freely given us the precious and very grand promises, that through these YOU may become sharers in divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.
2 Peter	61	1	5	Yes, for this very reason, by YOUR contributing in response all earnest effort, supply to YOUR faith virtue, to YOUR virtue knowledge,
2 Peter	61	1	6	to YOUR knowledge self-control, to YOUR self-control endurance, to YOUR endurance godly devotion,
2 Peter	61	1	7	to YOUR godly devotion brotherly affection, to YOUR brotherly affection love.
2 Peter	61	1	8	For if these things exist in YOU and overflow, they will prevent YOU from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter	61	1	9	For if these things are not present in anyone, he is blind, shutting his eyes to the light, and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago.
2 Peter	61	1	10	For this reason, brothers, all the more do YOUR utmost to make the calling and choosing of YOU sure for yourselves; for if YOU keep on doing these things YOU will by no means ever fail.
2 Peter	61	1	11	In fact, thus there will be richly supplied to YOU the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter	61	1	12	For this reason I shall be disposed always to remind YOU of these things, although YOU know them and are firmly set in the truth that is present in YOU.
2 Peter	61	1	13	But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to rouse YOU up by way of reminding YOU,
2 Peter	61	1	14	knowing as I do that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon to be, just as also our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me.
2 Peter	61	1	15	So I will do my utmost also at every time that, after my departure, YOU may be able to make mention of these things for yourselves.
2 Peter	61	1	16	No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we acquainted YOU with the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but it was by having become eyewitnesses of his magnificence.
2 Peter	61	1	17	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when words such as these were borne to him by the magnificent glory: “This is my son, my beloved, whom I myself have approved.”
2 Peter	61	1	18	Yes, these words we heard borne from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain.
2 Peter	61	1	19	Consequently we have the prophetic word made more sure; and YOU are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in YOUR hearts.
2 Peter	61	1	20	For YOU know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation.
2 Peter	61	1	21	For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.

2 Peter	61	2	1	However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among YOU. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.
2 Peter	61	2	2	Furthermore, many will follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account of these the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.
2 Peter	61	2	3	Also, with covetousness they will exploit YOU with counterfeit words. But as for them, the judgment from of old is not moving slowly, and the destruction of them is not slumbering.
2 Peter	61	2	4	Certainly if God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tartarus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment;
2 Peter	61	2	5	and he did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people;
2 Peter	61	2	6	and by reducing the cities Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come;
2 Peter	61	2	7	and he delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the indulgence of the law-defying people in loose conduct—
2 Peter	61	2	8	for that righteous man by what he saw and heard while dwelling among them from day to day was tormenting his righteous soul by reason of their lawless deeds—
2 Peter	61	2	9	Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off,
2 Peter	61	2	10	especially, however, those who go on after flesh with the desire to defile it and who look down on lordship. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble at glorious ones but speak abusively,
2 Peter	61	2	11	whereas angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them an accusation in abusive terms, not doing so out of respect for Jehovah.
2 Peter	61	2	12	But these men, like unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed, will, in the things of which they are ignorant and speak abusively, even suffer destruction in their own course of destruction,
2 Peter	61	2	13	wronging themselves as a reward for wrongdoing. They consider luxurious living in the daytime a pleasure. They are spots and blemishes, indulging with unrestrained delight in their deceptive teachings while feasting together with YOU.
2 Peter	61	2	14	They have eyes full of adultery and unable to desist from sin, and they entice unsteady souls. They have a heart trained in covetousness. They are accursed children.
2 Peter	61	2	15	Abandoning the straight path, they have been misled. They have followed the path of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the reward of wrongdoing,
2 Peter	61	2	16	but got a reproof for his own violation of what was right. A voiceless beast of burden, making utterance with the voice of a man, hindered the prophet’s mad course.
2 Peter	61	2	17	These are fountains without water, and mists driven by a violent storm, and for them the blackness of darkness has been reserved.
2 Peter	61	2	18	For they utter swelling expressions of no profit, and by the desires of the flesh and by loose habits they entice those who are just escaping from people who conduct themselves in error.
2 Peter	61	2	19	While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are existing as slaves of corruption. For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one.
2 Peter	61	2	20	Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first.
2 Peter	61	2	21	For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.
2 Peter	61	2	22	The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: “The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.”

2 Peter	61	3	1	Beloved ones, this is now the second letter I am writing YOU, in which, as in my first one, I am arousing YOUR clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder,
2 Peter	61	3	2	that YOU should remember the sayings previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through YOUR apostles.
2 Peter	61	3	3	For YOU know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires
2 Peter	61	3	4	and saying: “Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.”
2 Peter	61	3	5	For, according to their wish, this fact escapes their notice, that there were heavens from of old and an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God;
2 Peter	61	3	6	and by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water.
2 Peter	61	3	7	But by the same word the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.
2 Peter	61	3	8	However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter	61	3	9	Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.
2 Peter	61	3	10	Yet Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a hissing noise, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be discovered.
2 Peter	61	3	11	Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought YOU to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion,
2 Peter	61	3	12	awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements being intensely hot will melt!
2 Peter	61	3	13	But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.
2 Peter	61	3	14	Hence, beloved ones, since YOU are awaiting these things, do YOUR utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.
2 Peter	61	3	15	Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given him also wrote YOU,
2 Peter	61	3	16	speaking about these things as he does also in all his letters. In them, however, are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unsteady are twisting, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
2 Peter	61	3	17	YOU, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on YOUR guard that YOU may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people and fall from YOUR own steadfastness.
2 Peter	61	3	18	No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity.

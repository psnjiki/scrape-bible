1 Peter	60	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the temporary residents scattered about in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, to the ones chosen
1 Peter	60	1	2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, with sanctification by the spirit, for the purpose of their being obedient and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ: May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to YOU.
1 Peter	60	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1 Peter	60	1	4	to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for YOU,
1 Peter	60	1	5	who are being safeguarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time.
1 Peter	60	1	6	In this fact YOU are greatly rejoicing, though for a little while at present, if it must be, YOU have been grieved by various trials,
1 Peter	60	1	7	in order that the tested quality of YOUR faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter	60	1	8	Though YOU never saw him, YOU love him. Though YOU are not looking upon him at present, yet YOU exercise faith in him and are greatly rejoicing with an unspeakable and glorified joy,
1 Peter	60	1	9	as YOU receive the end of YOUR faith, the salvation of YOUR souls.
1 Peter	60	1	10	Concerning this very salvation a diligent inquiry and a careful search were made by the prophets who prophesied about the undeserved kindness meant for YOU.
1 Peter	60	1	11	They kept on investigating what particular season or what sort of season the spirit in them was indicating concerning Christ when it was bearing witness beforehand about the sufferings for Christ and about the glories to follow these.
1 Peter	60	1	12	It was revealed to them that, not to themselves, but to YOU, they were ministering the things that have now been announced to YOU through those who have declared the good news to YOU with holy spirit sent forth from heaven. Into these very things angels are desiring to peer.
1 Peter	60	1	13	Hence brace up YOUR minds for activity, keep YOUR senses completely; set YOUR hope upon the undeserved kindness that is to be brought to YOU at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter	60	1	14	As obedient children, quit being fashioned according to the desires YOU formerly had in YOUR ignorance,
1 Peter	60	1	15	but, in accord with the Holy One who called YOU, do YOU also become holy yourselves in all YOUR conduct,
1 Peter	60	1	16	because it is written: “YOU must be holy, because I am holy.”
1 Peter	60	1	17	Furthermore, if YOU are calling upon the Father who judges impartially according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear during the time of YOUR alien residence.
1 Peter	60	1	18	For YOU know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that YOU were delivered from YOUR fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from YOUR forefathers.
1 Peter	60	1	19	But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.
1 Peter	60	1	20	True, he was foreknown before the founding of the world, but he was made manifest at the end of the times for the sake of YOU
1 Peter	60	1	21	who through him are believers in God, the one who raised him up from the dead and gave him glory; so that YOUR faith and hope might be in God.
1 Peter	60	1	22	Now that YOU have purified YOUR souls by YOUR obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart.
1 Peter	60	1	23	For YOU have been given a new birth, not by corruptible, but by incorruptible reproductive seed, through the word of the living and enduring God.
1 Peter	60	1	24	For “all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of grass; the grass becomes withered, and the flower falls off,
1 Peter	60	1	25	but the saying of Jehovah endures forever.” Well, this is the “saying,” this which has been declared to YOU as good news.

1 Peter	60	2	1	Accordingly, put away all badness and all deceitfulness and hypocrisy and envies and all sorts of backbiting,
1 Peter	60	2	2	and, as newborn infants, form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word, that through it YOU may grow to salvation,
1 Peter	60	2	3	provided YOU have tasted that the Lord is kind.
1 Peter	60	2	4	Coming to him as to a living stone, rejected, it is true, by men, but chosen, precious, with God,
1 Peter	60	2	5	YOU yourselves also as living stones are being built up a spiritual house for the purpose of a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter	60	2	6	For it is contained in Scripture: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone, chosen, a foundation cornerstone, precious; and no one exercising faith in it will by any means come to disappointment.”
1 Peter	60	2	7	It is to YOU, therefore, that he is precious, because YOU are believers; but to those not believing, “the identical stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the corner,”
1 Peter	60	2	8	and “a stone of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense.” These are stumbling because they are disobedient to the word. To this very end they were also appointed.
1 Peter	60	2	9	But YOU are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that YOU should declare abroad the excellencies” of the one that called YOU out of darkness into his wonderful light.
1 Peter	60	2	10	For YOU were once not a people, but are now God’s people; YOU were those who had not been shown mercy, but are now those who have been shown mercy.
1 Peter	60	2	11	Beloved, I exhort YOU as aliens and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which are the very ones that carry on a conflict against the soul.
1 Peter	60	2	12	Maintain YOUR conduct fine among the nations, that, in the thing in which they are speaking against YOU as evildoers, they may as a result of YOUR fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.
1 Peter	60	2	13	For the Lord’s sake subject yourselves to every human creation: whether to a king as being superior
1 Peter	60	2	14	or to governors as being sent by him to inflict punishment on evildoers but to praise doers of good.
1 Peter	60	2	15	For so the will of God is, that by doing good YOU may muzzle the ignorant talk of the unreasonable men.
1 Peter	60	2	16	Be as free people, and yet holding YOUR freedom, not as a blind for badness, but as slaves of God.
1 Peter	60	2	17	Honor men of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers, be in fear of God, have honor for the king.
1 Peter	60	2	18	Let house servants be in subjection to their owners with all due fear, not only to the good and reasonable, but also to those hard to please.
1 Peter	60	2	19	For if someone, because of conscience toward God, bears up under grievous things and suffers unjustly, this is an agreeable thing.
1 Peter	60	2	20	For what merit is there in it if, when YOU are sinning and being slapped, YOU endure it? But if, when YOU are doing good and YOU suffer, YOU endure it, this is a thing agreeable with God.
1 Peter	60	2	21	In fact, to this course YOU were called, because even Christ suffered for YOU, leaving YOU a model for YOU to follow his steps closely.
1 Peter	60	2	22	He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.
1 Peter	60	2	23	When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.
1 Peter	60	2	24	He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness. And “by his stripes YOU were healed.”
1 Peter	60	2	25	For YOU were like sheep, going astray; but now YOU have returned to the shepherd and overseer of YOUR souls.

1 Peter	60	3	1	In like manner, YOU wives, be in subjection to YOUR own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives,
1 Peter	60	3	2	because of having been eyewitnesses of YOUR chaste conduct together with deep respect.
1 Peter	60	3	3	And do not let YOUR adornment be that of the external braiding of the hair and of the putting on of gold ornaments or the wearing of outer garments,
1 Peter	60	3	4	but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.
1 Peter	60	3	5	For so, too, formerly the holy women who were hoping in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,
1 Peter	60	3	6	as Sarah used to obey Abraham, calling him “lord.” And YOU have become her children, provided YOU keep on doing good and not fearing any cause for terror.
1 Peter	60	3	7	YOU husbands, continue dwelling in like manner with them according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since YOU are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life, in order for YOUR prayers not to be hindered.
1 Peter	60	3	8	Finally, all of YOU be like-minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind,
1 Peter	60	3	9	not paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling, but, to the contrary, bestowing a blessing, because YOU were called to this course, so that YOU might inherit a blessing.
1 Peter	60	3	10	For, “he that would love life and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from what is bad and his lips from speaking deception,
1 Peter	60	3	11	but let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
1 Peter	60	3	12	For the eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication; but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.”
1 Peter	60	3	13	Indeed, who is the man that will harm YOU if YOU become zealous for what is good?
1 Peter	60	3	14	But even if YOU should suffer for the sake of righteousness, YOU are happy. However, the object of their fear do not YOU fear, neither become agitated.
1 Peter	60	3	15	But sanctify the Christ as Lord in YOUR hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of YOU a reason for the hope in YOU, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.
1 Peter	60	3	16	Hold a good conscience, so that in the particular in which YOU are spoken against they may get ashamed who are speaking slightingly of YOUR good conduct in connection with Christ.
1 Peter	60	3	17	For it is better to suffer because YOU are doing good, if the will of God wishes it, than because YOU are doing evil.
1 Peter	60	3	18	Why, even Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead YOU to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.
1 Peter	60	3	19	In this state also he went his way and preached to the spirits in prison,
1 Peter	60	3	20	who had once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.
1 Peter	60	3	21	That which corresponds to this is also now saving YOU, namely, baptism, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the request made to God for a good conscience,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter	60	3	22	He is at God’s right hand, for he went his way to heaven; and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.

1 Peter	60	4	1	Therefore since Christ suffered in the flesh, YOU too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition; because the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins,
1 Peter	60	4	2	to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.
1 Peter	60	4	3	For the time that has passed by is sufficient for YOU to have worked out the will of the nations when YOU proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and illegal idolatries.
1 Peter	60	4	4	Because YOU do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of YOU.
1 Peter	60	4	5	But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.
1 Peter	60	4	6	In fact, for this purpose the good news was declared also to the dead, that they might be judged as to the flesh from the standpoint of men but might live as to the spirit from the standpoint of God.
1 Peter	60	4	7	But the end of all things has drawn close. Be sound in mind, therefore, and be vigilant with a view to prayers.
1 Peter	60	4	8	Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
1 Peter	60	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter	60	4	10	In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.
1 Peter	60	4	11	If anyone speaks, let him speak as it were the sacred pronouncements of God; if anyone ministers, let him minister as dependent on the strength that God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The glory and the might are his forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter	60	4	12	Beloved ones, do not be puzzled at the burning among YOU, which is happening to YOU for a trial, as though a strange thing were befalling YOU.
1 Peter	60	4	13	On the contrary, go on rejoicing forasmuch as YOU are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, that YOU may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.
1 Peter	60	4	14	If YOU are being reproached for the name of Christ, YOU are happy, because the spirit of glory, even the spirit of God, is resting upon YOU.
1 Peter	60	4	15	However, let none of YOU suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a busybody in other people’s matters.
1 Peter	60	4	16	But if he suffers as a Christian, let him not feel shame, but let him keep on glorifying God in this name.
1 Peter	60	4	17	For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. Now if it starts first with us, what will the end be of those who are not obedient to the good news of God?
1 Peter	60	4	18	“And if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly man and the sinner make a showing?”
1 Peter	60	4	19	So, then, also let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on commending their souls to a faithful Creator while they are doing good.

1 Peter	60	5	1	Therefore, to the older men among YOU I give this exhortation, for I too am an older man with them and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, a sharer even of the glory that is to be revealed:
1 Peter	60	5	2	Shepherd the flock of God in YOUR care, not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly;
1 Peter	60	5	3	neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.
1 Peter	60	5	4	And when the chief shepherd has been made manifest, YOU will receive the unfadable crown of glory.
1 Peter	60	5	5	In like manner, YOU younger men, be in subjection to the older men. But all of YOU gird yourselves with lowliness of mind toward one another, because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.
1 Peter	60	5	6	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt YOU in due time;
1 Peter	60	5	7	while YOU throw all YOUR anxiety upon him, because he cares for YOU.
1 Peter	60	5	8	Keep YOUR senses, be watchful. YOUR adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.
1 Peter	60	5	9	But take YOUR stand against him, solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of YOUR brothers in the world.
1 Peter	60	5	10	But, after YOU have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved kindness, who called YOU to his everlasting glory in union with Christ, will himself finish YOUR training, he will make YOU firm, he will make YOU strong.
1 Peter	60	5	11	To him be the might forever. Amen.
1 Peter	60	5	12	Through Silvanus, a faithful brother, as I account him, I have written YOU in few words, to give encouragement and an earnest witness that this is the true undeserved kindness of God; in which stand firm.
1 Peter	60	5	13	She who is in Babylon, a chosen one like YOU, sends YOU her greetings, and so does Mark my son.
1 Peter	60	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love. May all of YOU who are in union with Christ have peace.

Romans	45	1	1	Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ and called to be an apostle, separated to God’s good news,
Romans	45	1	2	which he promised aforetime through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans	45	1	3	concerning his Son, who sprang from the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans	45	1	4	but who with power was declared God’s Son according to the spirit of holiness by means of resurrection from the dead—yes, Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans	45	1	5	through whom we received undeserved kindness and an apostleship in order that there might be obedience of faith among all the nations respecting his name,
Romans	45	1	6	among which nations YOU also are those called to belong to Jesus Christ—
Romans	45	1	7	to all those who are in Rome as God’s beloved ones, called to be holy ones: May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	45	1	8	First of all, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of YOU, because YOUR faith is talked about throughout the whole world.
Romans	45	1	9	For God, to whom I render sacred service with my spirit in connection with the good news about his Son, is my witness of how without ceasing I always make mention of YOU in my prayers,
Romans	45	1	10	begging that if at all possible I may now at last be prospered in the will of God so as to come to YOU.
Romans	45	1	11	For I am longing to see YOU, that I may impart some spiritual gift to YOU in order for YOU to be made firm;
Romans	45	1	12	or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among YOU, by each one through the other’s faith, both YOURS and mine.
Romans	45	1	13	But I do not want YOU to fail to know, brothers, that I many times purposed to come to YOU, but I have been hindered until now, in order that I might acquire some fruitage also among YOU even as among the rest of the nations.
Romans	45	1	14	Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to senseless ones I am a debtor:
Romans	45	1	15	so there is eagerness on my part to declare the good news also to YOU there in Rome.
Romans	45	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek;
Romans	45	1	17	for in it God’s righteousness is being revealed by reason of faith and toward faith, just as it is written: “But the righteous one—by means of faith he will live.”
Romans	45	1	18	For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way,
Romans	45	1	19	because what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them.
Romans	45	1	20	For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable;
Romans	45	1	21	because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened.
Romans	45	1	22	Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish
Romans	45	1	23	and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things.
Romans	45	1	24	Therefore God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them,
Romans	45	1	25	even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever. Amen.
Romans	45	1	26	That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature;
Romans	45	1	27	and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error.
Romans	45	1	28	And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting,
Romans	45	1	29	filled as they were with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malicious disposition, being whisperers,
Romans	45	1	30	backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, self-assuming, inventors of injurious things, disobedient to parents,
Romans	45	1	31	without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless.
Romans	45	1	32	Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them but also consent with those practicing them.

Romans	45	2	1	Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for in the thing in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, inasmuch as you that judge practice the same things.
Romans	45	2	2	Now we know that the judgment of God is, in accord with truth, against those who practice such things.
Romans	45	2	3	But do you have this idea, O man, while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, that you will escape the judgment of God?
Romans	45	2	4	Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, because you do not know that the kindly quality of God is trying to lead you to repentance?
Romans	45	2	5	But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment.
Romans	45	2	6	And he will render to each one according to his works:
Romans	45	2	7	everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good;
Romans	45	2	8	however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and anger,
Romans	45	2	9	tribulation and distress, upon the soul of every man who works what is injurious, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;
Romans	45	2	10	but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.
Romans	45	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.
Romans	45	2	12	For instance, all those who sinned without law will also perish without law; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law.
Romans	45	2	13	For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous.
Romans	45	2	14	For whenever people of the nations that do not have law do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves.
Romans	45	2	15	They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them and, between their own thoughts, they are being accused or even excused.
Romans	45	2	16	This will be in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind, according to the good news I declare.
Romans	45	2	17	If, now, you are a Jew in name and are resting upon law and taking pride in God,
Romans	45	2	18	and you know his will and approve of things that are excellent because you are orally instructed out of the Law;
Romans	45	2	19	and you are persuaded that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness,
Romans	45	2	20	a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of babes, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law—
Romans	45	2	21	do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching “Do not steal,” do you steal?
Romans	45	2	22	You, the one saying “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You, the one expressing abhorrence of the idols, do you rob temples?
Romans	45	2	23	You, who take pride in law, do you by your transgressing of the Law dishonor God?
Romans	45	2	24	For “the name of God is being blasphemed on account of YOU people among the nations”; just as it is written.
Romans	45	2	25	Circumcision is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
Romans	45	2	26	If, therefore, an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not?
Romans	45	2	27	And the uncircumcised person that is such by nature will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who with its written code and circumcision are a transgressor of law.
Romans	45	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh.
Romans	45	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code. The praise of that one comes, not from men, but from God.

Romans	45	3	1	What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision?
Romans	45	3	2	A great deal in every way. First of all, because they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.
Romans	45	3	3	What, then, is the case? If some did not express faith, will their lack of faith perhaps make the faithfulness of God without effect?
Romans	45	3	4	Never may that happen! But let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, even as it is written: “That you might be proved righteous in your words and might win when you are being judged.”
Romans	45	3	5	However, if our unrighteousness brings God’s righteousness to the fore, what shall we say? God is not unjust when he vents his wrath, is he? (I am speaking as a man does.)
Romans	45	3	6	Never may that happen! How, otherwise, will God judge the world?
Romans	45	3	7	Yet if by reason of my lie the truth of God has been made more prominent to his glory, why am I also yet being judged as a sinner?
Romans	45	3	8	And why not say, just as it is falsely charged to us and just as some men state that we say: “Let us do the bad things that the good things may come”? The judgment against those men is in harmony with justice.
Romans	45	3	9	What then? Are we in a better position? Not at all! For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin;
Romans	45	3	10	just as it is written: “There is not a righteous man, not even one;
Romans	45	3	11	there is no one that has any insight, there is no one that seeks for God.
Romans	45	3	12	All men have deflected, all of them together have become worthless; there is no one that does kindness, there is not so much as one.”
Romans	45	3	13	“Their throat is an opened grave, they have used deceit with their tongues.” “Poison of asps is behind their lips.”
Romans	45	3	14	“And their mouth is full of cursing and bitter expression.”
Romans	45	3	15	“Their feet are speedy to shed blood.”
Romans	45	3	16	“Ruin and misery are in their ways,
Romans	45	3	17	and they have not known the way of peace.”
Romans	45	3	18	“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
Romans	45	3	19	Now we know that all the things the Law says it addresses to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become liable to God for punishment.
Romans	45	3	20	Therefore by works of law no flesh will be declared righteous before him, for by law is the accurate knowledge of sin.
Romans	45	3	21	But now apart from law God’s righteousness has been made manifest, as it is borne witness to by the Law and the Prophets;
Romans	45	3	22	yes, God’s righteousness through the faith in Jesus Christ, for all those having faith. For there is no distinction.
Romans	45	3	23	For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans	45	3	24	and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus.
Romans	45	3	25	God set him forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood. This was in order to exhibit his own righteousness, because he was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past while God was exercising forbearance;
Romans	45	3	26	so as to exhibit his own righteousness in this present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.
Romans	45	3	27	Where, then, is the boasting? It is shut out. Through what law? That of works? No indeed, but through the law of faith.
Romans	45	3	28	For we reckon that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law.
Romans	45	3	29	Or is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of people of the nations? Yes, of people of the nations also,
Romans	45	3	30	if truly God is one, who will declare circumcised people righteous as a result of faith and uncircumcised people righteous by means of their faith.
Romans	45	3	31	Do we, then, abolish law by means of our faith? Never may that happen! On the contrary, we establish law.

Romans	45	4	1	That being so, what shall we say about Abraham our forefather according to the flesh?
Romans	45	4	2	If, for instance, Abraham were declared righteous as a result of works, he would have ground for boasting; but not with God.
Romans	45	4	3	For what does the scripture say? “Abraham exercised faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
Romans	45	4	4	Now to the man that works the pay is counted, not as an undeserved kindness, but as a debt.
Romans	45	4	5	On the other hand, to the man that does not work but puts faith in him who declares the ungodly one righteous, his faith is counted as righteousness.
Romans	45	4	6	Just as David also speaks of the happiness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:
Romans	45	4	7	“Happy are those whose lawless deeds have been pardoned and whose sins have been covered;
Romans	45	4	8	happy is the man whose sin Jehovah will by no means take into account.”
Romans	45	4	9	Does this happiness, then, come upon circumcised people or also upon uncircumcised people? For we say: “His faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.”
Romans	45	4	10	Under what circumstances, then, was it counted? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
Romans	45	4	11	And he received a sign, namely, circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, that he might be the father of all those having faith while in uncircumcision, in order for righteousness to be counted to them;
Romans	45	4	12	and a father of circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision, but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of that faith while in the uncircumcised state which our father Abraham had.
Romans	45	4	13	For it was not through law that Abraham or his seed had the promise that he should be heir of a world, but it was through the righteousness by faith.
Romans	45	4	14	For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith has been made useless and the promise has been abolished.
Romans	45	4	15	In reality the Law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression.
Romans	45	4	16	On this account it was as a result of faith, that it might be according to undeserved kindness, in order for the promise to be sure to all his seed, not only to that which adheres to the Law, but also to that which adheres to the faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all,
Romans	45	4	17	just as it is written: “I have appointed you a father of many nations.”) This was in the sight of the One in whom he had faith, even of God, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they were.
Romans	45	4	18	Although beyond hope, yet based on hope he had faith, that he might become the father of many nations in accord with what had been said: “So your seed will be.”
Romans	45	4	19	And, although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now already deadened, as he was about one hundred years old, also the deadness of the womb of Sarah.
Romans	45	4	20	But because of the promise of God he did not waver in a lack of faith, but became powerful by his faith, giving God glory
Romans	45	4	21	and being fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do.
Romans	45	4	22	Hence “it was counted to him as righteousness.”
Romans	45	4	23	That “it was counted to him” was written, however, not for his sake only,
Romans	45	4	24	but also for the sake of us to whom it is destined to be counted, because we believe on him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead.
Romans	45	4	25	He was delivered up for the sake of our trespasses and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Romans	45	5	1	Therefore, now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans	45	5	2	through whom also we have gained our approach by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand; and let us exult, based on hope of the glory of God.
Romans	45	5	3	And not only that, but let us exult while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance;
Romans	45	5	4	endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope,
Romans	45	5	5	and the hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given us.
Romans	45	5	6	For, indeed, Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time.
Romans	45	5	7	For hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die.
Romans	45	5	8	But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans	45	5	9	Much more, therefore, since we have been declared righteous now by his blood, shall we be saved through him from wrath.
Romans	45	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
Romans	45	5	11	And not only that, but we are also exulting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Romans	45	5	12	That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.
Romans	45	5	13	For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law.
Romans	45	5	14	Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam, who bears a resemblance to him that was to come.
Romans	45	5	15	But it is not with the gift as it was with the trespass. For if by one man’s trespass many died, the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift with the undeserved kindness by the one man Jesus Christ abounded much more to many.
Romans	45	5	16	Also, it is not with the free gift as it was with the way things worked through the one man that sinned. For the judgment resulted from one trespass in condemnation, but the gift resulted from many trespasses in a declaration of righteousness.
Romans	45	5	17	For if by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king through that one, much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness rule as kings in life through the one person, Jesus Christ.
Romans	45	5	18	So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, likewise also through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is a declaring of them righteous for life.
Romans	45	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience of the one person many will be constituted righteous.
Romans	45	5	20	Now the Law came in beside in order that trespassing might abound. But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more.
Romans	45	5	21	To what end? That, just as sin ruled as king with death, likewise also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness with everlasting life in view through Jesus Christ our Lord.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Romans	45	6	1	Consequently, what shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that undeserved kindness may abound?
Romans	45	6	2	Never may that happen! Seeing that we died with reference to sin, how shall we keep on living any longer in it?
Romans	45	6	3	Or do YOU not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans	45	6	4	Therefore we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, we also should likewise walk in a newness of life.
Romans	45	6	5	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection;
Romans	45	6	6	because we know that our old personality was impaled with him, that our sinful body might be made inactive, that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin.
Romans	45	6	7	For he who has died has been acquitted from his sin.
Romans	45	6	8	Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.
Romans	45	6	9	For we know that Christ, now that he has been raised up from the dead, dies no more; death is master over him no more.
Romans	45	6	10	For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time; but the life that he lives, he lives with reference to God.
Romans	45	6	11	Likewise also YOU: reckon yourselves to be dead indeed with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus.
Romans	45	6	12	Therefore do not let sin continue to rule as king in YOUR mortal bodies that YOU should obey their desires.
Romans	45	6	13	Neither go on presenting YOUR members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also YOUR members to God as weapons of righteousness.
Romans	45	6	14	For sin must not be master over YOU, seeing that YOU are not under law but under undeserved kindness.
Romans	45	6	15	What follows? Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Never may that happen!
Romans	45	6	16	Do YOU not know that if YOU keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, YOU are slaves of him because YOU obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view?
Romans	45	6	17	But thanks to God that YOU were the slaves of sin but YOU became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which YOU were handed over.
Romans	45	6	18	Yes, since YOU were set free from sin, YOU became slaves to righteousness.
Romans	45	6	19	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of YOUR flesh: for even as YOU presented YOUR members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness with lawlessness in view, so now present YOUR members as slaves to righteousness with holiness in view.
Romans	45	6	20	For when YOU were slaves of sin, YOU were free as to righteousness.
Romans	45	6	21	What, then, was the fruit that YOU used to have at that time? Things of which YOU are now ashamed. For the end of those things is death.
Romans	45	6	22	However, now, because YOU were set free from sin but became slaves to God, YOU are having YOUR fruit in the way of holiness, and the end everlasting life.
Romans	45	6	23	For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Romans	45	7	1	Can it be that YOU do not know, brothers, (for I am speaking to those who know law,) that the Law is master over a man as long as he lives?
Romans	45	7	2	For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law of her husband.
Romans	45	7	3	So, then, while her husband is living, she would be styled an adulteress if she became another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man’s.
Romans	45	7	4	So, my brothers, YOU also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ, that YOU might become another’s, the one’s who was raised up from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God.
Romans	45	7	5	For when we were in accord with the flesh, the sinful passions that were excited by the Law were at work in our members that we should bring forth fruit to death.
Romans	45	7	6	But now we have been discharged from the Law, because we have died to that by which we were being held fast, that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit, and not in the old sense by the written code.
Romans	45	7	7	What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: “You must not covet.”
Romans	45	7	8	But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead.
Romans	45	7	9	In fact, I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died.
Romans	45	7	10	And the commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death.
Romans	45	7	11	For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it.
Romans	45	7	12	Wherefore, on its part, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
Romans	45	7	13	Did, then, what is good become death to me? Never may that happen! But sin did, that it might be shown as sin working out death for me through that which is good; that sin might become far more sinful through the commandment.
Romans	45	7	14	For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
Romans	45	7	15	For what I am working out I do not know. For what I wish, this I do not practice; but what I hate is what I do.
Romans	45	7	16	However, if what I do not wish is what I do, I agree that the Law is fine.
Romans	45	7	17	But now the one working it out is no longer I, but sin that resides in me.
Romans	45	7	18	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for ability to wish is present with me, but ability to work out what is fine is not present.
Romans	45	7	19	For the good that I wish I do not do, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.
Romans	45	7	20	If, now, what I do not wish is what I do, the one working it out is no longer I, but the sin dwelling in me.
Romans	45	7	21	I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.
Romans	45	7	22	I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,
Romans	45	7	23	but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.
Romans	45	7	24	Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?
Romans	45	7	25	Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with my flesh to sin’s law.

Romans	45	8	1	Therefore those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation.
Romans	45	8	2	For the law of that spirit which gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans	45	8	3	For, there being an incapability on the part of the Law, while it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans	45	8	4	that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk, not in accord with the flesh, but in accord with the spirit.
Romans	45	8	5	For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit.
Romans	45	8	6	For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace;
Romans	45	8	7	because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be.
Romans	45	8	8	So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.
Romans	45	8	9	However, YOU are in harmony, not with the flesh, but with the spirit, if God’s spirit truly dwells in YOU. But if anyone does not have Christ’s spirit, this one does not belong to him.
Romans	45	8	10	But if Christ is in union with YOU, the body indeed is dead on account of sin, but the spirit is life on account of righteousness.
Romans	45	8	11	If, now, the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in YOU, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make YOUR mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in YOU.
Romans	45	8	12	So, then, brothers, we are under obligation, not to the flesh to live in accord with the flesh;
Romans	45	8	13	for if YOU live in accord with the flesh YOU are sure to die; but if YOU put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, YOU will live.
Romans	45	8	14	For all who are led by God’s spirit, these are God’s sons.
Romans	45	8	15	For YOU did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but YOU received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: “Abba, Father!”
Romans	45	8	16	The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.
Romans	45	8	17	If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.
Romans	45	8	18	Consequently I reckon that the sufferings of the present season do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us.
Romans	45	8	19	For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans	45	8	20	For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but through him that subjected it, on the basis of hope
Romans	45	8	21	that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.
Romans	45	8	22	For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.
Romans	45	8	23	Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves, while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom.
Romans	45	8	24	For we were saved in this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for when a man sees a thing, does he hope for it?
Romans	45	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see, we keep on waiting for it with endurance.
Romans	45	8	26	In like manner the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the problem of what we should pray for as we need to we do not know, but the spirit itself pleads for us with groanings unuttered.
Romans	45	8	27	Yet he who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in accord with God for holy ones.
Romans	45	8	28	Now we know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God, those who are the ones called according to his purpose;
Romans	45	8	29	because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
Romans	45	8	30	Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous. Finally those whom he declared righteous are the ones he also glorified.
Romans	45	8	31	What, then, shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who will be against us?
Romans	45	8	32	He who did not even spare his own Son but delivered him up for us all, why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things?
Romans	45	8	33	Who will file accusation against God’s chosen ones? God is the One who declares them righteous.
Romans	45	8	34	Who is he that will condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, rather the one who was raised up from the dead, who is on the right hand of God, who also pleads for us.
Romans	45	8	35	Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?
Romans	45	8	36	Just as it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.”
Romans	45	8	37	To the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us.
Romans	45	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers
Romans	45	8	39	nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans	45	9	1	I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying, since my conscience bears witness with me in holy spirit,
Romans	45	9	2	that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans	45	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were separated as the cursed one from the Christ in behalf of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh,
Romans	45	9	4	who, as such, are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the sacred service and the promises;
Romans	45	9	5	to whom the forefathers belong and from whom the Christ sprang according to the flesh: God, who is over all, be blessed forever. Amen.
Romans	45	9	6	However, it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who spring from Israel are really “Israel.”
Romans	45	9	7	Neither because they are Abraham’s seed are they all children, but: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.”
Romans	45	9	8	That is, the children in the flesh are not really the children of God, but the children by the promise are counted as the seed.
Romans	45	9	9	For the word of promise was as follows: “At this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.”
Romans	45	9	10	Yet not that case alone, but also when Rebekah conceived twins from the one man, Isaac our forefather:
Romans	45	9	11	for when they had not yet been born nor had practiced anything good or vile, in order that the purpose of God respecting the choosing might continue dependent, not upon works, but upon the One who calls,
Romans	45	9	12	it was said to her: “The older will be the slave of the younger.”
Romans	45	9	13	Just as it is written: “I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated.”
Romans	45	9	14	What shall we say, then? Is there injustice with God? Never may that become so!
Romans	45	9	15	For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy upon whomever I do have mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I do show compassion.”
Romans	45	9	16	So, then, it depends, not upon the one wishing nor upon the one running, but upon God, who has mercy.
Romans	45	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “For this very cause I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may show my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.”
Romans	45	9	18	So, then, upon whom he wishes he has mercy, but whom he wishes he lets become obstinate.
Romans	45	9	19	You will therefore say to me: “Why does he yet find fault? For who has withstood his express will?”
Romans	45	9	20	O man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, “Why did you make me this way?”
Romans	45	9	21	What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use?
Romans	45	9	22	If, now, God, although having the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, tolerated with much long-suffering vessels of wrath made fit for destruction,
Romans	45	9	23	in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
Romans	45	9	24	namely, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, what of it?
Romans	45	9	25	It is as he says also in Hosea: “Those not my people I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not beloved ‘beloved’;
Romans	45	9	26	and in the place where it was said to them, ‘YOU are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”
Romans	45	9	27	Moreover, Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Although the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved.
Romans	45	9	28	For Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.”
Romans	45	9	29	Also, just as Isaiah had said aforetime: “Unless Jehovah of armies had left a seed to us, we should have become just like Sodom, and we should have been made just like Gomorrah.”
Romans	45	9	30	What shall we say, then? That people of the nations, although not pursuing righteousness, caught up with righteousness, the righteousness that results from faith;
Romans	45	9	31	but Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law.
Romans	45	9	32	For what reason? Because he pursued it, not by faith, but as by works. They stumbled on the “stone of stumbling”;
Romans	45	9	33	as it is written: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense, but he that rests his faith on it will not come to disappointment.”

Romans	45	10	1	Brothers, the goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are, indeed, for their salvation.
Romans	45	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge;
Romans	45	10	3	for, because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Romans	45	10	4	For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.
Romans	45	10	5	For Moses writes that the man that has done the righteousness of the Law will live by it.
Romans	45	10	6	But the righteousness resulting from faith speaks in this manner: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ that is, to bring Christ down;
Romans	45	10	7	or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.”
Romans	45	10	8	But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart”; that is, the “word” of faith, which we are preaching.
Romans	45	10	9	For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your own mouth,’ that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans	45	10	10	For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.
Romans	45	10	11	For the Scripture says: “None that rests his faith on him will be disappointed.”
Romans	45	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for there is the same Lord over all, who is rich to all those calling upon him.
Romans	45	10	13	For “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”
Romans	45	10	14	However, how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?
Romans	45	10	15	How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent forth? Just as it is written: “How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!”
Romans	45	10	16	Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says: “Jehovah, who put faith in the thing heard from us?”
Romans	45	10	17	So faith follows the thing heard. In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ.
Romans	45	10	18	Nevertheless I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, “into all the earth their sound went out, and to the extremities of the inhabited earth their utterances.”
Romans	45	10	19	Nevertheless I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? First Moses says: “I will incite YOU people to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite YOU to violent anger through a stupid nation.”
Romans	45	10	20	But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I became manifest to those who were not asking for me.”
Romans	45	10	21	But as respects Israel he says: “All day long I have spread out my hands toward a people that is disobedient and talks back.”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Romans	45	11	1	I ask, then, God did not reject his people, did he? Never may that happen! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans	45	11	2	God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. Why, do YOU not know what the Scripture says in connection with Elijah, as he pleads with God against Israel?
Romans	45	11	3	“Jehovah, they have killed your prophets, they have dug up your altars, and I alone am left, and they are looking for my soul.”
Romans	45	11	4	Yet, what does the divine pronouncement say to him? “I have left seven thousand men over for myself, men who have not bent the knee to Baal.”
Romans	45	11	5	In this way, therefore, at the present season also a remnant has turned up according to a choosing due to undeserved kindness.
Romans	45	11	6	Now if it is by undeserved kindness, it is no longer due to works; otherwise, the undeserved kindness no longer proves to be undeserved kindness.
Romans	45	11	7	What, then? The very thing Israel is earnestly seeking he did not obtain, but the ones chosen obtained it. The rest had their sensibilities blunted;
Romans	45	11	8	just as it is written: “God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes so as not to see and ears so as not to hear, down to this very day.”
Romans	45	11	9	Also, David says: “Let their table become for them a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution;
Romans	45	11	10	let their eyes become darkened so as not to see, and always bow down their back.”
Romans	45	11	11	Therefore I ask, Did they stumble so that they fell completely? Never may that happen! But by their false step there is salvation to people of the nations, to incite them to jealousy.
Romans	45	11	12	Now if their false step means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, how much more will the full number of them mean it!
Romans	45	11	13	Now I speak to YOU who are people of the nations. Forasmuch as I am, in reality, an apostle to the nations, I glorify my ministry,
Romans	45	11	14	if I may by any means incite those who are my own flesh to jealousy and save some from among them.
Romans	45	11	15	For if the casting of them away means reconciliation for the world, what will the receiving of them mean but life from the dead?
Romans	45	11	16	Further, if the part taken as firstfruits is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are also.
Romans	45	11	17	However, if some of the branches were broken off but you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the olive’s root of fatness,
Romans	45	11	18	do not be exulting over the branches. If, though, you are exulting over them, it is not you that bear the root, but the root bears you.
Romans	45	11	19	You will say, then: “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.”
Romans	45	11	20	All right! For their lack of faith they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Quit having lofty ideas, but be in fear.
Romans	45	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
Romans	45	11	22	See, therefore, God’s kindness and severity. Toward those who fell there is severity, but toward you there is God’s kindness, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be lopped off.
Romans	45	11	23	They also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans	45	11	24	For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree, how much rather will these who are natural be grafted into their own olive tree!
Romans	45	11	25	For I do not want YOU, brothers, to be ignorant of this sacred secret, in order for YOU not to be discreet in your own eyes: that a dulling of sensibilities has happened in part to Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in,
Romans	45	11	26	and in this manner all Israel will be saved. Just as it is written: “The deliverer will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob.
Romans	45	11	27	And this is the covenant on my part with them, when I take their sins away.”
Romans	45	11	28	True, with reference to the good news they are enemies for YOUR sakes, but with reference to God’s choosing they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
Romans	45	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret.
Romans	45	11	30	For just as YOU were once disobedient to God but have now been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
Romans	45	11	31	so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to YOU, that they themselves also may now be shown mercy.
Romans	45	11	32	For God has shut them all up together in disobedience, that he might show all of them mercy.
Romans	45	11	33	O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!
Romans	45	11	34	For “who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?”
Romans	45	11	35	Or, “Who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?”
Romans	45	11	36	Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.

Romans	45	12	1	Consequently I entreat YOU by the compassions of God, brothers, to present YOUR bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with YOUR power of reason.
Romans	45	12	2	And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making YOUR mind over, that YOU may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
Romans	45	12	3	For through the undeserved kindness given to me I tell everyone there among YOU not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think; but to think so as to have a sound mind, each one as God has distributed to him a measure of faith.
Romans	45	12	4	For just as we have in one body many members, but the members do not all have the same function,
Romans	45	12	5	so we, although many, are one body in union with Christ, but members belonging individually to one another.
Romans	45	12	6	Since, then, we have gifts differing according to the undeserved kindness given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the faith proportioned to us;
Romans	45	12	7	or a ministry, let us be at this ministry; or he that teaches, let him be at his teaching;
Romans	45	12	8	or he that exhorts, let him be at his exhortation; he that distributes, let him do it with liberality; he that presides, let him do it in real earnest; he that shows mercy, let him do it with cheerfulness.
Romans	45	12	9	Let YOUR love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is wicked, cling to what is good.
Romans	45	12	10	In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another take the lead.
Romans	45	12	11	Do not loiter at YOUR business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.
Romans	45	12	12	Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer.
Romans	45	12	13	Share with the holy ones according to their needs. Follow the course of hospitality.
Romans	45	12	14	Keep on blessing those who persecute; be blessing and do not be cursing.
Romans	45	12	15	Rejoice with people who rejoice; weep with people who weep.
Romans	45	12	16	Be minded the same way toward others as to yourselves; do not be minding lofty things, but be led along with the lowly things. Do not become discreet in YOUR own eyes.
Romans	45	12	17	Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men.
Romans	45	12	18	If possible, as far as it depends upon YOU, be peaceable with all men.
Romans	45	12	19	Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.”
Romans	45	12	20	But, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head.”
Romans	45	12	21	Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.

Romans	45	13	1	Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God.
Romans	45	13	2	Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will receive judgment to themselves.
Romans	45	13	3	For those ruling are an object of fear, not to the good deed, but to the bad. Do you, then, want to have no fear of the authority? Keep doing good, and you will have praise from it;
Romans	45	13	4	for it is God’s minister to you for your good. But if you are doing what is bad, be in fear: for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword; for it is God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath upon the one practicing what is bad.
Romans	45	13	5	There is therefore compelling reason for YOU people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath but also on account of YOUR conscience.
Romans	45	13	6	For that is why YOU are also paying taxes; for they are God’s public servants constantly serving this very purpose.
Romans	45	13	7	Render to all their dues, to him who calls for the tax, the tax; to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute; to him who calls for fear, such fear; to him who calls for honor, such honor.
Romans	45	13	8	Do not YOU people be owing anybody a single thing, except to love one another; for he that loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.
Romans	45	13	9	For the law code, “You must not commit adultery, You must not murder, You must not steal, You must not covet,” and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this word, namely, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
Romans	45	13	10	Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore love is the law’s fulfillment.
Romans	45	13	11	Do this, too, because YOU people know the season, that it is already the hour for YOU to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.
Romans	45	13	12	The night is well along; the day has drawn near. Let us therefore put off the works belonging to darkness and let us put on the weapons of the light.
Romans	45	13	13	As in the daytime let us walk decently, not in revelries and drunken bouts, not in illicit intercourse and loose conduct, not in strife and jealousy.
Romans	45	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.

Romans	45	14	1	Welcome the man having weaknesses in his faith, but not to make decisions on inward questionings.
Romans	45	14	2	One man has faith to eat everything, but the man who is weak eats vegetables.
Romans	45	14	3	Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating, and let the one not eating not judge the one eating, for God has welcomed that one.
Romans	45	14	4	Who are you to judge the house servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for Jehovah can make him stand.
Romans	45	14	5	One man judges one day as above another; another man judges one day as all others; let each man be fully convinced in his own mind.
Romans	45	14	6	He who observes the day observes it to Jehovah. Also, he who eats, eats to Jehovah, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat does not eat to Jehovah, and yet gives thanks to God.
Romans	45	14	7	None of us, in fact, lives with regard to himself only, and no one dies with regard to himself only;
Romans	45	14	8	for both if we live, we live to Jehovah, and if we die, we die to Jehovah. Therefore both if we live and if we die, we belong to Jehovah.
Romans	45	14	9	For to this end Christ died and came to life again, that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.
Romans	45	14	10	But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you also look down on your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God;
Romans	45	14	11	for it is written: “‘As I live,’ says Jehovah, ‘to me every knee will bend down, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God.’”
Romans	45	14	12	So, then, each of us will render an account for himself to God.
Romans	45	14	13	Therefore let us not be judging one another any longer, but rather make this YOUR decision, not to put before a brother a stumbling block or a cause for tripping.
Romans	45	14	14	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiled in itself; only where a man considers something to be defiled, to him it is defiled.
Romans	45	14	15	For if because of food your brother is being grieved, you are no longer walking in accord with love. Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died.
Romans	45	14	16	Do not, therefore, let the good YOU people do be spoken of with injury to YOU.
Romans	45	14	17	For the kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit.
Romans	45	14	18	For he who in this regard slaves for Christ is acceptable to God and has approval with men.
Romans	45	14	19	So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another.
Romans	45	14	20	Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food. True, all things are clean, but it is injurious to the man who with an occasion for stumbling eats.
Romans	45	14	21	It is well not to eat flesh or to drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles.
Romans	45	14	22	The faith that you have, have it in accord with yourself in the sight of God. Happy is the man that does not put himself on judgment by what he approves.
Romans	45	14	23	But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, because he does not eat out of faith. Indeed, everything that is not out of faith is sin.

Romans	45	15	1	We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves.
Romans	45	15	2	Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.
Romans	45	15	3	For even the Christ did not please himself; but just as it is written: “The reproaches of those who were reproaching you have fallen upon me.”
Romans	45	15	4	For all the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.
Romans	45	15	5	Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant YOU to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had,
Romans	45	15	6	that with one accord YOU may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	45	15	7	Therefore welcome one another, just as the Christ also welcomed us, with glory to God in view.
Romans	45	15	8	For I say that Christ actually became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers,
Romans	45	15	9	and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: “That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations and to your name I will make melody.”
Romans	45	15	10	And again he says: “Be glad, YOU nations, with his people.”
Romans	45	15	11	And again: “Praise Jehovah, all YOU nations, and let all the peoples praise him.”
Romans	45	15	12	And again Isaiah says: “There will be the root of Jesse, and there will be one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.”
Romans	45	15	13	May the God who gives hope fill YOU with all joy and peace by YOUR believing, that YOU may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.
Romans	45	15	14	Now I myself also am persuaded about YOU, my brothers, that YOU yourselves are also full of goodness, as YOU have been filled with all knowledge, and that YOU can also admonish one another.
Romans	45	15	15	However, I am writing YOU the more outspokenly on some points, as if reminding YOU again, because of the undeserved kindness given to me from God
Romans	45	15	16	for me to be a public servant of Christ Jesus to the nations, engaging in the holy work of the good news of God, in order that the offering, namely, these nations, might prove to be acceptable, it being sanctified with holy spirit.
Romans	45	15	17	Therefore I have cause for exulting in Christ Jesus when it comes to things pertaining to God.
Romans	45	15	18	For I will not venture to tell one thing if it is not of those things which Christ worked through me for the nations to be obedient, by my word and deed,
Romans	45	15	19	with the power of signs and portents, with the power of holy spirit; so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.
Romans	45	15	20	In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where Christ had already been named, in order that I might not be building on another man’s foundation;
Romans	45	15	21	but, just as it is written: “Those to whom no announcement has been made about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”
Romans	45	15	22	Therefore also I was many times hindered from getting to YOU.
Romans	45	15	23	But now that I no longer have untouched territory in these regions, and for some years having had a longing to get to YOU
Romans	45	15	24	whenever I am on my way to Spain, I hope, above all, when I am on the journey there, to get a look at YOU and to be escorted partway there by YOU after I have first in some measure been satisfied with your company.
Romans	45	15	25	But now I am about to journey to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.
Romans	45	15	26	For those in Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to share up their things by a contribution to the poor of the holy ones in Jerusalem.
Romans	45	15	27	True, they have been pleased to do so, and yet they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister publicly to these with things for the fleshly body.
Romans	45	15	28	Hence after I have finished with this and have got this fruit securely to them, I shall depart by way of YOU for Spain.
Romans	45	15	29	Moreover, I know that when I do come to YOU I shall come with a full measure of blessing from Christ.
Romans	45	15	30	Now I exhort YOU, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit, that YOU exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me,
Romans	45	15	31	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea and that my ministry which is for Jerusalem may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones,
Romans	45	15	32	so that when I get to YOU with joy by God’s will I shall be refreshed together with YOU.
Romans	45	15	33	May the God who gives peace be with all of YOU. Amen.

Romans	45	16	1	I recommend to YOU Phoebe our sister, who is a minister of the congregation that is in Cenchreae,
Romans	45	16	2	that YOU may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the holy ones, and that YOU may assist her in any matter where she may need YOU, for she herself also proved to be a defender of many, yes, of me myself.
Romans	45	16	3	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans	45	16	4	who have risked their own necks for my soul, to whom not only I but also all the congregations of the nations render thanks;
Romans	45	16	5	and greet the congregation that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is a firstfruits of Asia for Christ.
Romans	45	16	6	Greet Mary, who has performed many labors for YOU.
Romans	45	16	7	Greet Andronicus and Junias my relatives and my fellow captives, who are men of note among the apostles and who have been in union with Christ longer than I have.
Romans	45	16	8	Give my greetings to Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Romans	45	16	9	Greet Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.
Romans	45	16	10	Greet Apelles, the approved one in Christ. Greet those from the household of Aristobulus.
Romans	45	16	11	Greet Herodion my relative. Greet those from the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
Romans	45	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, women who are working hard in the Lord. Greet Persis our beloved one, for she performed many labors in the Lord.
Romans	45	16	13	Greet Rufus the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Romans	45	16	14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them.
Romans	45	16	15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them.
Romans	45	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the congregations of the Christ greet YOU.
Romans	45	16	17	Now I exhort YOU, brothers, to keep your eye on those who cause divisions and occasions for stumbling contrary to the teaching that YOU have learned, and avoid them.
Romans	45	16	18	For men of that sort are slaves, not of our Lord Christ, but of their own bellies; and by smooth talk and complimentary speech they seduce the hearts of guileless ones.
Romans	45	16	19	For YOUR obedience has come to the notice of all. I therefore rejoice over YOU. But I want YOU to be wise as to what is good, but innocent as to what is evil.
Romans	45	16	20	For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under YOUR feet shortly. May the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus be with YOU.
Romans	45	16	21	Timothy my fellow worker greets YOU, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my relatives.
Romans	45	16	22	I, Tertius, who have done the writing of this letter, greet YOU in the Lord.
Romans	45	16	23	Gaius, my host and that of all the congregation, greets YOU. Erastus the city steward greets YOU, and so does Quartus his brother.
Romans	45	16	24	——
Romans	45	16	25	Now to him who can make YOU firm in accord with the good news I declare and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret which has been kept in silence for long-lasting times
Romans	45	16	26	but has now been made manifest and has been made known through the prophetic scriptures among all the nations in accord with the command of the everlasting God to promote obedience by faith;
Romans	45	16	27	to God, wise alone, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.

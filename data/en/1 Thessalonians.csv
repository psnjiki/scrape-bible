1 Thessalonians	52	1	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the congregation of the Thessalonians in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace.
1 Thessalonians	52	1	2	We always thank God when we make mention concerning all of YOU in our prayers,
1 Thessalonians	52	1	3	for we bear incessantly in mind YOUR faithful work and your loving labor and your endurance due to your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.
1 Thessalonians	52	1	4	For we know, brothers loved by God, his choosing of YOU,
1 Thessalonians	52	1	5	because the good news we preach did not turn up among YOU with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and strong conviction, just as YOU know what sort of men we became to YOU for YOUR sakes;
1 Thessalonians	52	1	6	and YOU became imitators of us and of the Lord, seeing that YOU accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit,
1 Thessalonians	52	1	7	so that YOU came to be an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians	52	1	8	The fact is, not only has the word of Jehovah sounded forth from YOU in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place YOUR faith toward God has spread abroad, so that we do not need to say anything.
1 Thessalonians	52	1	9	For they themselves keep reporting about the way we first entered in among YOU and how YOU turned to God from YOUR idols to slave for a living and true God,
1 Thessalonians	52	1	10	and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised up from the dead, namely, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.

1 Thessalonians	52	2	1	To be sure, YOU yourselves know, brothers, how our visit to YOU has not been without results,
1 Thessalonians	52	2	2	but how, after we had first suffered and been insolently treated (just as YOU know) in Philippi, we mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to YOU the good news of God with a great deal of struggling.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	3	For the exhortation we give does not arise from error or from uncleanness or with deceit,
1 Thessalonians	52	2	4	but, just as we have been proved by God as fit to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, as pleasing, not men, but God, who makes proof of our hearts.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	5	In fact, at no time have we turned up either with flattering speech, (just as YOU know) or with a false front for covetousness, God is witness!
1 Thessalonians	52	2	6	Neither have we been seeking glory from men, no, either from YOU or from others, though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	7	To the contrary, we became gentle in the midst of YOU, as when a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	8	So, having a tender affection for YOU, we were well pleased to impart to YOU, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because YOU became beloved to us.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	9	Certainly YOU bear in mind, brothers, our labor and toil. It was with working night and day, so as not to put an expensive burden upon any one of YOU, that we preached the good news of God to YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	10	YOU are witnesses, God is also, how loyal and righteous and unblamable we proved to be to YOU believers.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	11	In harmony with that YOU well know how, as a father does his children, we kept exhorting each one of YOU, and consoling and bearing witness to YOU,
1 Thessalonians	52	2	12	to the end that YOU should go on walking worthily of God who is calling YOU to his kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	13	Indeed, that is why we also thank God incessantly, because when YOU received God’s word, which YOU heard from us, YOU accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in YOU believers.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	14	For YOU became imitators, brothers, of the congregations of God that are in Judea in union with Christ Jesus, because YOU also began suffering at the hands of YOUR own countrymen the same things as they also are suffering at the hands of the Jews,
1 Thessalonians	52	2	15	who killed even the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us. Furthermore, they are not pleasing God, but are against the interests of all men,
1 Thessalonians	52	2	16	as they try to hinder us from speaking to people of the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But his wrath has at length come upon them.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	17	As for ourselves, brothers, when we were bereaved of YOU for but a short time, in person, not in heart, we endeavored far more than is usual to see YOUR faces with great desire.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	18	For this reason we wanted to come to YOU, yes, I Paul, both once and a second time, but Satan cut across our path.
1 Thessalonians	52	2	19	For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact YOU?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence?
1 Thessalonians	52	2	20	YOU certainly are our glory and joy.

1 Thessalonians	52	3	1	Hence, when we could bear it no longer, we saw good to be left alone in Athens;
1 Thessalonians	52	3	2	and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the good news about the Christ, in order to make YOU firm and comfort YOU in behalf of YOUR faith,
1 Thessalonians	52	3	3	that no one might be swayed by these tribulations. For YOU yourselves know we are appointed to this very thing.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	4	In fact, too, when we were with YOU, we used to tell YOU beforehand that we were destined to suffer tribulation, just as it has also happened and as YOU know.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	5	That is why, indeed, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to know of YOUR faithfulness, as perhaps in some way the Tempter might have tempted YOU, and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	6	But Timothy has just now come to us from YOU and given us the good news about YOUR faithfulness and love, and that YOU continue having good remembrance of us always, yearning to see us in the same way, indeed, as we also do YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	7	That is why, brothers, we have been comforted over YOU in all our necessity and tribulation through the faithfulness YOU show,
1 Thessalonians	52	3	8	because now we live if YOU stand firm in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	9	For what thanksgiving can we render to God concerning YOU in return for all the joy with which we are rejoicing on YOUR account before our God,
1 Thessalonians	52	3	10	while night and day we make more than extraordinary supplications to see YOUR faces and to make good the things that are lacking about YOUR faith?
1 Thessalonians	52	3	11	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way prosperously to YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	3	12	Moreover, may the Lord cause YOU to increase, yes, make YOU abound, in love to one another and to all, even as we also do to YOU;
1 Thessalonians	52	3	13	to the end that he may make YOUR hearts firm, unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the presence of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.

1 Thessalonians	52	4	1	Finally, brothers, we request YOU and exhort YOU by the Lord Jesus, just as YOU received the instruction from us on how YOU ought to walk and please God, just as YOU are in fact walking, that YOU would keep on doing it more fully.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	2	For YOU know the orders we gave YOU through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	3	For this is what God wills, the sanctifying of YOU, that YOU abstain from fornication;
1 Thessalonians	52	4	4	that each one of YOU should know how to get possession of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
1 Thessalonians	52	4	5	not in covetous sexual appetite such as also those nations have which do not know God;
1 Thessalonians	52	4	6	that no one go to the point of harming and encroach upon the rights of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah is one who exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told YOU beforehand and also gave YOU a thorough witness.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	7	For God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	8	So, then, the man that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	9	However, with reference to brotherly love, YOU do not need us to be writing YOU, for YOU yourselves are taught by God to love one another;
1 Thessalonians	52	4	10	and, in fact, YOU are doing it to all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we exhort YOU, brothers, to go on doing it in fuller measure,
1 Thessalonians	52	4	11	and to make it YOUR aim to live quietly and to mind YOUR own business and work with YOUR hands, just as we ordered YOU;
1 Thessalonians	52	4	12	so that YOU may be walking decently as regards people outside and not be needing anything.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	13	Moreover, brothers, we do not want YOU to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping in death; that YOU may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	14	For if our faith is that Jesus died and rose again, so, too, those who have fallen asleep in death through Jesus God will bring with him.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	15	For this is what we tell YOU by Jehovah’s word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death;
1 Thessalonians	52	4	16	because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	17	Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians	52	4	18	Consequently keep comforting one another with these words.

1 Thessalonians	52	5	1	Now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, YOU need nothing to be written to YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	2	For YOU yourselves know quite well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	3	Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman; and they will by no means escape.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	4	But YOU, brothers, YOU are not in darkness, so that that day should overtake YOU as it would thieves,
1 Thessalonians	52	5	5	for YOU are all sons of light and sons of day. We belong neither to night nor to darkness.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	6	So, then, let us not sleep on as the rest do, but let us stay awake and keep our senses.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	7	For those who sleep are accustomed to sleep at night, and those who get drunk are usually drunk at night.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	8	But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation;
1 Thessalonians	52	5	9	because God assigned us, not to wrath, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	10	He died for us, that, whether we stay awake or are asleep, we should live together with him.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	11	Therefore keep comforting one another and building one another up, just as YOU are in fact doing.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	12	Now we request YOU, brothers, to have regard for those who are working hard among YOU and presiding over YOU in the Lord and admonishing YOU;
1 Thessalonians	52	5	13	and to give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work. Be peaceable with one another.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	14	On the other hand, we exhort YOU, brothers, admonish the disorderly, speak consolingly to the depressed souls, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	15	See that no one renders injury for injury to anyone else, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	16	Always be rejoicing.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	17	Pray incessantly.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	18	In connection with everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in union with Christ Jesus respecting YOU.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	19	Do not put out the fire of the spirit.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	20	Do not treat prophesyings with contempt.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	21	Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	22	Abstain from every form of wickedness.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	23	May the very God of peace sanctify YOU completely. And sound in every respect may the spirit and soul and body of YOU brothers be preserved in a blameless manner at the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	24	He who is calling YOU is faithful, and he will also do it.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	25	Brothers, continue in prayer for us.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	27	I am putting YOU under the solemn obligation by the Lord for this letter to be read to all the brothers.
1 Thessalonians	52	5	28	The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with YOU.

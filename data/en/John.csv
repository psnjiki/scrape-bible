John	43	1	1	In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.
John	43	1	2	This one was in the beginning with God.
John	43	1	3	All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence. What has come into existence
John	43	1	4	by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John	43	1	5	And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.
John	43	1	6	There arose a man that was sent forth as a representative of God: his name was John.
John	43	1	7	This man came for a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, that people of all sorts might believe through him.
John	43	1	8	He was not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.
John	43	1	9	The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.
John	43	1	10	He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him.
John	43	1	11	He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in.
John	43	1	12	However, as many as did receive him, to them he gave authority to become God’s children, because they were exercising faith in his name;
John	43	1	13	and they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.
John	43	1	14	So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of undeserved kindness and truth.
John	43	1	15	(John bore witness about him, yes, he actually cried out—this was the one who said it—saying: “The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.”)
John	43	1	16	For we all received from out of his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.
John	43	1	17	Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.
John	43	1	18	No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom position with the Father is the one that has explained him.
John	43	1	19	Now this is the witness of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him to ask him: “Who are you?”
John	43	1	20	And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed: “I am not the Christ.”
John	43	1	21	And they asked him: “What, then? Are you Elijah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you The Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”
John	43	1	22	Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
John	43	1	23	He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘MAKE the way of Jehovah straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”
John	43	1	24	Now those sent forth were from the Pharisees.
John	43	1	25	So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you yourself are not the Christ or Elijah or The Prophet?”
John	43	1	26	John answered them, saying: “I baptize in water. In the midst of YOU one is standing whom YOU do not know,
John	43	1	27	the one coming behind me, but the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
John	43	1	28	These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John	43	1	29	The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!
John	43	1	30	This is the one about whom I said, Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.
John	43	1	31	Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was that he might be made manifest to Israel.”
John	43	1	32	John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.
John	43	1	33	Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.’
John	43	1	34	And I have seen it, and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.”
John	43	1	35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
John	43	1	36	and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: “See, the Lamb of God!”
John	43	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John	43	1	38	Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: “What are YOU looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?”
John	43	1	39	He said to them: “Come, and YOU will see.” Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour.
John	43	1	40	Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed Jesus.
John	43	1	41	First this one found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Messiah” (which means, when translated, Christ).
John	43	1	42	He led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked upon him he said: “You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).
John	43	1	43	The next day he desired to depart for Galilee. So Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Be my follower.”
John	43	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter.
John	43	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”
John	43	1	46	But Nathanael said to him: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.”
John	43	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him: “See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.”
John	43	1	48	Nathanael said to him: “How does it come that you know me?” Jesus in answer said to him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
John	43	1	49	Nathanael answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.”
John	43	1	50	Jesus in answer said to him: “Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe? You will see things greater than these.”
John	43	1	51	He further said to him: “Most truly I say to YOU men, YOU will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”

John	43	2	1	Now on the third day a marriage feast took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
John	43	2	2	Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.
John	43	2	3	When the wine ran short the mother of Jesus said to him: “They have no wine.”
John	43	2	4	But Jesus said to her: “What have I to do with you, woman? My hour has not yet come.”
John	43	2	5	His mother said to those ministering: “Whatever he tells YOU, do.”
John	43	2	6	As it was, there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures.
John	43	2	7	Jesus said to them: “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.
John	43	2	8	And he said to them: “Draw some out now and take it to the director of the feast.” So they took it.
John	43	2	9	When, now, the director of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine but did not know what its source was, although those ministering who had drawn out the water knew, the director of the feast called the bridegroom
John	43	2	10	and said to him: “Every other man puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have reserved the fine wine until now.”
John	43	2	11	Jesus performed this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him.
John	43	2	12	After this he and his mother and brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but they did not stay there many days.
John	43	2	13	Now the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John	43	2	14	And he found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats.
John	43	2	15	So, after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
John	43	2	16	And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise!”
John	43	2	17	His disciples called to mind that it is written: “The zeal for your house will eat me up.”
John	43	2	18	Therefore, in answer, the Jews said to him: “What sign have you to show us, since you are doing these things?”
John	43	2	19	In answer Jesus said to them: “Break down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
John	43	2	20	Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built in forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”
John	43	2	21	But he was talking about the temple of his body.
John	43	2	22	When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples called to mind that he used to say this; and they believed the Scripture and the saying that Jesus said.
John	43	2	23	However, when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at its festival, many people put their faith in his name, viewing his signs that he was performing.
John	43	2	24	But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them because of his knowing them all
John	43	2	25	and because he was in no need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.

John	43	3	1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.
John	43	3	2	This one came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you as a teacher have come from God; for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.”
John	43	3	3	In answer Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
John	43	3	4	Nicodemus said to him: “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?”
John	43	3	5	Jesus answered: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
John	43	3	6	What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.
John	43	3	7	Do not marvel because I told you, YOU people must be born again.
John	43	3	8	The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone that has been born from the spirit.”
John	43	3	9	In answer Nicodemus said to him: “How can these things come about?”
John	43	3	10	In answer Jesus said to him: “Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?
John	43	3	11	Most truly I say to you, What we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness of, but YOU people do not receive the witness we give.
John	43	3	12	If I have told YOU earthly things and yet YOU do not believe, how will YOU believe if I tell YOU heavenly things?
John	43	3	13	Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.
John	43	3	14	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up,
John	43	3	15	that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.
John	43	3	16	“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.
John	43	3	17	For God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.
John	43	3	18	He that exercises faith in him is not to be judged. He that does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
John	43	3	19	Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.
John	43	3	20	For he that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved.
John	43	3	21	But he that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.”
John	43	3	22	After these things Jesus and his disciples went into Judean country, and there he spent some time with them and did baptizing.
John	43	3	23	But John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was a great quantity of water there, and people kept coming and being baptized;
John	43	3	24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John	43	3	25	Therefore a dispute arose on the part of the disciples of John with a Jew concerning purification.
John	43	3	26	So they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man that was with you across the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, see, this one is baptizing and all are going to him.”
John	43	3	27	In answer John said: “A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven.
John	43	3	28	YOU yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent forth in advance of that one.
John	43	3	29	He that has the bride is the bridegroom. However, the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore this joy of mine has been made full.
John	43	3	30	That one must go on increasing, but I must go on decreasing.”
John	43	3	31	He that comes from above is over all others. He that is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth. He that comes from heaven is over all others.
John	43	3	32	What he has seen and heard, of this he bears witness, but no man is accepting his witness.
John	43	3	33	He that has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that God is true.
John	43	3	34	For the one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God, for he does not give the spirit by measure.
John	43	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
John	43	3	36	He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.

John	43	4	1	When, now, the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
John	43	4	2	although, indeed, Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—
John	43	4	3	he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.
John	43	4	4	But it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.
John	43	4	5	Accordingly he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son.
John	43	4	6	In fact, Jacob’s fountain was there. Now Jesus, tired out from the journey, was sitting at the fountain just as he was. The hour was about the sixth.
John	43	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”
John	43	4	8	(For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy foodstuffs.)
John	43	4	9	Therefore the Samaritan woman said to him: “How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink, when I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John	43	4	10	In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known the free gift of God and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
John	43	4	11	She said to him: “Sir, you have not even a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, therefore, do you have this living water?
John	43	4	12	You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who himself together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?”
John	43	4	13	In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.
John	43	4	14	Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”
John	43	4	15	The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”
John	43	4	16	He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come to this place.”
John	43	4	17	In answer the woman said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You said well, ‘A husband I do not have.’
John	43	4	18	For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”
John	43	4	19	The woman said to him: “Sir, I perceive you are a prophet.
John	43	4	20	Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain; but YOU people say that in Jerusalem is the place where persons ought to worship.”
John	43	4	21	Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, The hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will YOU people worship the Father.
John	43	4	22	YOU worship what YOU do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews.
John	43	4	23	Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.
John	43	4	24	God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”
John	43	4	25	The woman said to him: “I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one arrives, he will declare all things to us openly.”
John	43	4	26	Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking to you am he.”
John	43	4	27	Now at this point his disciples arrived, and they began to wonder because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you talk with her?”
John	43	4	28	The woman, therefore, left her water jar and went off into the city and told the men:
John	43	4	29	“Come here, see a man that told me all the things I did. This is not perhaps the Christ, is it?”
John	43	4	30	They went out of the city and began coming to him.
John	43	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.”
John	43	4	32	But he said to them: “I have food to eat of which YOU do not know.”
John	43	4	33	Therefore the disciples began saying to one another: “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”
John	43	4	34	Jesus said to them: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.
John	43	4	35	Do YOU not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to YOU: Lift up YOUR eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already
John	43	4	36	the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
John	43	4	37	In this respect, indeed, the saying is true, One is the sower and another the reaper.
John	43	4	38	I dispatched YOU to reap what YOU have spent no labor on. Others have labored, and YOU have entered into the benefit of their labor.”
John	43	4	39	Now many of the Samaritans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman who said in witness: “He told me all the things I did.”
John	43	4	40	Therefore when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.
John	43	4	41	Consequently many more believed on account of what he said,
John	43	4	42	and they began to say to the woman: “We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.”
John	43	4	43	After the two days he left there for Galilee.
John	43	4	44	Jesus himself, however, bore witness that in his own homeland a prophet has no honor.
John	43	4	45	When, therefore, he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they also had gone to the festival.
John	43	4	46	Accordingly he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a certain attendant of the king whose son was sick in Capernaum.
John	43	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went off to him and began asking him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.
John	43	4	48	However, Jesus said to him: “Unless YOU people see signs and wonders, YOU will by no means believe.”
John	43	4	49	The attendant of the king said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”
John	43	4	50	Jesus said to him: “Go your way; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.
John	43	4	51	But already while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was living.
John	43	4	52	Therefore he began to inquire of them the hour in which he got better in health. Accordingly they said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
John	43	4	53	Therefore the father knew it was in the very hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son lives.” And he and his whole household believed.
John	43	4	54	Again this was the second sign Jesus performed when he came out of Judea into Galilee.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
John	43	5	1	After these things there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John	43	5	2	Now in Jerusalem at the sheepgate there is a pool designated in Hebrew Bethzatha, with five colonnades.
John	43	5	3	In these a multitude of the sick, blind, lame and those with withered members, was lying down.
John	43	5	4	——
John	43	5	5	But a certain man was there who had been in his sickness for thirty-eight years.
John	43	5	6	Seeing this man lying down, and being aware that he had already been sick a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want to become sound in health?”
John	43	5	7	The sick man answered him: “Sir, I do not have a man to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; but while I am coming another steps down ahead of me.”
John	43	5	8	Jesus said to him: “Get up, pick up your cot and walk.”
John	43	5	9	With that the man immediately became sound in health, and he picked up his cot and began to walk. Now on that day it was a sabbath.
John	43	5	10	Therefore the Jews began to say to the cured man: “It is Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry the cot.”
John	43	5	11	But he answered them: “The very one that made me sound in health said to me, ‘Pick up your cot and walk.’”
John	43	5	12	They asked him: “Who is the man that told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”
John	43	5	13	But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had turned aside, there being a crowd in the place.
John	43	5	14	After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you have become sound in health. Do not sin anymore, in order that something worse does not happen to you.”
John	43	5	15	The man went away and told the Jews it was Jesus that made him sound in health.
John	43	5	16	So on this account the Jews went persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during Sabbath.
John	43	5	17	But he answered them: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.”
John	43	5	18	On this account, indeed, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
John	43	5	19	Therefore, in answer, Jesus went on to say to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he beholds the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
John	43	5	20	For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, in order that YOU may marvel.
John	43	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to.
John	43	5	22	For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son,
John	43	5	23	in order that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He that does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
John	43	5	24	Most truly I say to YOU, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.
John	43	5	25	“Most truly I say to YOU, The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live.
John	43	5	26	For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.
John	43	5	27	And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is.
John	43	5	28	Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice
John	43	5	29	and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.
John	43	5	30	I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; just as I hear, I judge; and the judgment that I render is righteous, because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John	43	5	31	“If I alone bear witness about myself, my witness is not true.
John	43	5	32	There is another that bears witness about me, and I know that the witness which he bears about me is true.
John	43	5	33	YOU have dispatched men to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
John	43	5	34	However, I do not accept the witness from man, but I say these things that YOU may be saved.
John	43	5	35	That man was a burning and shining lamp, and YOU for a short time were willing to rejoice greatly in his light.
John	43	5	36	But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, the works themselves that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father dispatched me.
John	43	5	37	Also, the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. YOU have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure;
John	43	5	38	and YOU do not have his word remaining in YOU, because the very one whom he dispatched YOU do not believe.
John	43	5	39	“YOU are searching the Scriptures, because YOU think that by means of them YOU will have everlasting life; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me.
John	43	5	40	And yet YOU do not want to come to me that YOU may have life.
John	43	5	41	I do not accept glory from men,
John	43	5	42	but I well know that YOU do not have the love of God in YOU.
John	43	5	43	I have come in the name of my Father, but YOU do not receive me; if someone else arrived in his own name, YOU would receive that one.
John	43	5	44	How can YOU believe, when YOU are accepting glory from one another and YOU are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?
John	43	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse YOU to the Father; there is one that accuses YOU, Moses, in whom YOU have put YOUR hope.
John	43	5	46	In fact, if YOU believed Moses YOU would believe me, for that one wrote about me.
John	43	5	47	But if YOU do not believe the writings of that one, how will YOU believe my sayings?”

John	43	6	1	After these things Jesus departed across the sea of Galilee, or Tiberias.
John	43	6	2	But a great crowd kept following him, because they were beholding the signs he was performing upon those who were ill.
John	43	6	3	So Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he was sitting with his disciples.
John	43	6	4	Now the passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.
John	43	6	5	When, therefore, Jesus raised his eyes and observed that a great crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where shall we buy loaves for these to eat?”
John	43	6	6	However, he was saying this to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
John	43	6	7	Philip answered him: “Two hundred denarii worth of loaves is not enough for them, so that each one may get a little.”
John	43	6	8	One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
John	43	6	9	“Here is a little boy that has five barley loaves and two small fishes. But what are these among so many?”
John	43	6	10	Jesus said: “HAVE the men recline as at meal.” Now there was a lot of grass in the place. Therefore the men reclined, about five thousand in number.
John	43	6	11	So Jesus took the loaves and, after giving thanks, he distributed them to those reclining, likewise also as much of the small fishes as they wanted.
John	43	6	12	But when they had their fill he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments that remain over, so that nothing is wasted.”
John	43	6	13	Therefore they gathered them together, and they filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
John	43	6	14	Hence when the men saw the signs he performed, they began to say: “This is for a certainty the prophet that was to come into the world.”
John	43	6	15	Therefore Jesus, knowing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone.
John	43	6	16	When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,
John	43	6	17	and, boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Capernaum. Well, by now it had grown dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John	43	6	18	Also, the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
John	43	6	19	However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they beheld Jesus walking upon the sea and getting near the boat; and they became fearful.
John	43	6	20	But he said to them: “It is I; have no fear!”
John	43	6	21	Therefore they were willing to take him into the boat, and directly the boat was at the land to which they were trying to go.
John	43	6	22	The next day the crowd that was standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there except a little one, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples but that only his disciples had left;
John	43	6	23	but boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John	43	6	24	Therefore when the crowd saw that neither Jesus was there nor his disciples, they boarded their little boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.
John	43	6	25	So when they found him across the sea they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
John	43	6	26	Jesus answered them and said: “Most truly I say to YOU, YOU are looking for me, not because YOU saw signs, but because YOU ate from the loaves and were satisfied.
John	43	6	27	Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting, which the Son of man will give YOU; for upon this one the Father, even God, has put his seal of approval.”
John	43	6	28	Therefore they said to him: “What shall we do to work the works of God?”
John	43	6	29	In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that YOU exercise faith in him whom that One sent forth.”
John	43	6	30	Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you performing as a sign, in order for us to see it and believe you? What work are you doing?
John	43	6	31	Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
John	43	6	32	Hence Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Moses did not give YOU the bread from heaven, but my Father does give YOU the true bread from heaven.
John	43	6	33	For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
John	43	6	34	Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”
John	43	6	35	Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. He that comes to me will not get hungry at all, and he that exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.
John	43	6	36	But I have said to YOU, YOU have even seen me and yet do not believe.
John	43	6	37	Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one that comes to me I will by no means drive away;
John	43	6	38	because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.
John	43	6	39	This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day.
John	43	6	40	For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”
John	43	6	41	Therefore the Jews began to murmur at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven”;
John	43	6	42	and they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it that now he says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
John	43	6	43	In answer Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.
John	43	6	44	No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him; and I will resurrect him in the last day.
John	43	6	45	It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me.
John	43	6	46	Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God; this one has seen the Father.
John	43	6	47	Most truly I say to YOU, He that believes has everlasting life.
John	43	6	48	“I am the bread of life.
John	43	6	49	YOUR forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet died.
John	43	6	50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
John	43	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”
John	43	6	52	Therefore the Jews began contending with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
John	43	6	53	Accordingly Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Unless YOU eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, YOU have no life in yourselves.
John	43	6	54	He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I shall resurrect him at the last day;
John	43	6	55	for my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
John	43	6	56	He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.
John	43	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me forth and I live because of the Father, he also that feeds on me, even that one will live because of me.
John	43	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when YOUR forefathers ate and yet died. He that feeds on this bread will live forever.”
John	43	6	59	These things he said as he was teaching in public assembly at Capernaum.
John	43	6	60	Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”
John	43	6	61	But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: “Does this stumble YOU?
John	43	6	62	What, therefore, if YOU should behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?
John	43	6	63	It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to YOU are spirit and are life.
John	43	6	64	But there are some of YOU that do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.
John	43	6	65	So he went on to say: “This is why I have said to YOU, No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”
John	43	6	66	Owing to this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.
John	43	6	67	Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “YOU do not want to go also, do YOU?”
John	43	6	68	Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life;
John	43	6	69	and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
John	43	6	70	Jesus answered them: “I chose YOU twelve, did I not? Yet one of YOU is a slanderer.”
John	43	6	71	He was, in fact, speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot; for this one was going to betray him, although one of the twelve.

John	43	7	1	Now after these things Jesus continued walking about in Galilee, for he did not want to walk about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.
John	43	7	2	However, the festival of the Jews, the festival of tabernacles, was near.
John	43	7	3	Therefore his brothers said to him: “Pass on over from here and go into Judea, in order that your disciples also may behold the works you do.
John	43	7	4	For nobody does anything in secret while himself seeking to be known publicly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.”
John	43	7	5	His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him.
John	43	7	6	Therefore Jesus said to them: “My due time is not yet present, but YOUR due time is always at hand.
John	43	7	7	The world has no reason to hate YOU, but it hates me, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are wicked.
John	43	7	8	YOU go up to the festival; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my due time has not yet fully come.”
John	43	7	9	So after he told them these things, he remained in Galilee.
John	43	7	10	But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up himself, not openly but as in secret.
John	43	7	11	Therefore the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying: “Where is that man?”
John	43	7	12	And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds. Some would say: “He is a good man.” Others would say: “He is not, but he misleads the crowd.”
John	43	7	13	No one, of course, would speak about him publicly because of the fear of the Jews.
John	43	7	14	When by now the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.
John	43	7	15	Therefore the Jews fell to wondering, saying: “How does this man have a knowledge of letters, when he has not studied at the schools?”
John	43	7	16	Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.
John	43	7	17	If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.
John	43	7	18	He that speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
John	43	7	19	Moses gave YOU the Law, did he not? But not one of YOU obeys the Law. Why are YOU seeking to kill me?”
John	43	7	20	The crowd answered: “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?”
John	43	7	21	In answer Jesus said to them: “One deed I performed, and YOU are all wondering.
John	43	7	22	For this reason Moses has given YOU the circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but that it is from the forefathers—and YOU circumcise a man on a sabbath.
John	43	7	23	If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken, are YOU violently angry at me because I made a man completely sound in health on a sabbath?
John	43	7	24	Stop judging from the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”
John	43	7	25	Therefore some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say: “This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not?
John	43	7	26	And yet, see! he is speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. The rulers have not come to know for a certainty that this is the Christ, have they?
John	43	7	27	On the contrary, we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one is to know where he is from.”
John	43	7	28	Therefore Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple and said: “YOU both know me and know where I am from. Also, I have not come of my own initiative, but he that sent me is real, and YOU do not know him.
John	43	7	29	I know him, because I am a representative from him, and that One sent me forth.”
John	43	7	30	Hence they began seeking to get hold of him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.
John	43	7	31	Still, many of the crowd put faith in him; and they commenced saying: “When the Christ arrives, he will not perform more signs than this man has performed, will he?”
John	43	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees dispatched officers to get hold of him.
John	43	7	33	Therefore Jesus said: “I continue a little while longer with YOU before I go to him that sent me.
John	43	7	34	YOU will look for me, but YOU will not find me, and where I am YOU cannot come.”
John	43	7	35	Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where does this man intend going, so that we shall not find him? He does not intend to go to the Jews dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he?
John	43	7	36	What does this saying mean that he said, ‘YOU will look for me, but YOU will not find me, and where I am YOU cannot come’?”
John	43	7	37	Now on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus was standing up and he cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
John	43	7	38	He that puts faith in me, just as the Scripture has said, ‘Out from his inmost part streams of living water will flow.’”
John	43	7	39	However, he said this concerning the spirit which those who put faith in him were about to receive; for as yet there was no spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
John	43	7	40	Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words began saying: “This is for a certainty The Prophet.”
John	43	7	41	Others were saying: “This is the Christ.” But some were saying: “The Christ is not actually coming out of Galilee, is he?
John	43	7	42	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem the village where David used to be?”
John	43	7	43	Therefore a division over him developed among the crowd.
John	43	7	44	Some of them, though, were wanting to get hold of him, but no one did lay his hands upon him.
John	43	7	45	Therefore the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and the latter said to them: “Why is it YOU did not bring him in?”
John	43	7	46	The officers replied: “Never has another man spoken like this.”
John	43	7	47	In turn the Pharisees answered: “YOU have not been misled also, have YOU?
John	43	7	48	Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he?
John	43	7	49	But this crowd that does not know the Law are accursed people.”
John	43	7	50	Nicodemus, who had come to him previously, and who was one of them, said to them:
John	43	7	51	“Our law does not judge a man unless first it has heard from him and come to know what he is doing, does it?”
John	43	7	52	In answer they said to him: “You are not also out of Galilee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galilee.”
John	43	7	53	So they went each one to his home.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
John	43	8	1	So they went each one to his home.
John	43	8	2	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John	43	8	3	At daybreak, however, he again presented himself at the temple, and all the people began coming to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.
John	43	8	4	Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught at adultery, and, after standing her in their midst,
John	43	8	5	they said to him: “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery.
John	43	8	6	In the Law Moses prescribed for us to stone such sort of women. What, really, do you say?”
John	43	8	7	Of course, they were saying this to put him to the test, in order to have something with which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and began to write with his finger in the ground.
John	43	8	8	When they persisted in asking him, he straightened up and said to them: “Let the one of YOU that is sinless be the first to throw a stone at her.”
John	43	8	9	And bending over again he kept on writing in the ground.
John	43	8	10	But those who heard this began going out, one by one, starting with the older men, and he was left alone, and the woman that was in their midst.
John	43	8	11	Straightening up, Jesus said to her: “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
John	43	8	12	She said: “No one, sir.” Jesus said: “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on practice sin no more.”
John	43	8	13	Therefore Jesus spoke again to them, saying: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.”
John	43	8	14	Hence the Pharisees said to him: “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.”
John	43	8	15	In answer Jesus said to them: “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But YOU do not know where I came from and where I am going.
John	43	8	16	YOU judge according to the flesh; I do not judge any man at all.
John	43	8	17	And yet if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.
John	43	8	18	Also, in YOUR own Law it is written, ‘The witness of two men is true.’
John	43	8	19	I am one that bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.”
John	43	8	20	Therefore they went on to say to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “YOU know neither me nor my Father. If YOU did know me, YOU would know my Father also.”
John	43	8	21	These sayings he spoke in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one laid hold of him, because his hour had not yet come.
John	43	8	22	Hence he said to them again: “I am going away, and YOU will look for me, and yet YOU will die in YOUR sin. Where I am going YOU cannot come.”
John	43	8	23	Therefore the Jews began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going YOU cannot come.’”
John	43	8	24	So he went on to say to them: “YOU are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. YOU are from this world; I am not from this world.
John	43	8	25	Therefore I said to YOU, YOU will die in YOUR sins. For if YOU do not believe that I am he, YOU will die in YOUR sins.”
John	43	8	26	Therefore they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “Why am I even speaking to YOU at all?
John	43	8	27	I have many things to speak concerning YOU and to pass judgment upon. As a matter of fact, he that sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.”
John	43	8	28	They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father.
John	43	8	29	Therefore Jesus said: “When once YOU have lifted up the Son of man, then YOU will know that I am he, and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things.
John	43	8	30	And he that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”
John	43	8	31	As he was speaking these things, many put faith in him.
John	43	8	32	And so Jesus went on to say to the Jews that had believed him: “If YOU remain in my word, YOU are really my disciples,
John	43	8	33	and YOU will know the truth, and the truth will set YOU free.”
John	43	8	34	They replied to him: “We are Abraham’s offspring and never have we been slaves to anybody. How is it you say, ‘YOU will become free’?”
John	43	8	35	Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Every doer of sin is a slave of sin.
John	43	8	36	Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever.
John	43	8	37	Therefore if the Son sets YOU free, YOU will be actually free.
John	43	8	38	I know that YOU are Abraham’s offspring; but YOU are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among YOU.
John	43	8	39	What things I have seen with my Father I speak; and YOU, therefore, do the things YOU have heard from YOUR father.”
John	43	8	40	In answer they said to him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If YOU are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.
John	43	8	41	But now YOU are seeking to kill me, a man that has told YOU the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
John	43	8	42	YOU do the works of YOUR father.” They said to him: “We were not born from fornication; we have one Father, God.”
John	43	8	43	Jesus said to them: “If God were YOUR Father, YOU would love me, for from God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth.
John	43	8	44	Why is it YOU do not know what I am speaking? Because YOU cannot listen to my word.
John	43	8	45	YOU are from YOUR father the Devil, and YOU wish to do the desires of YOUR father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.
John	43	8	46	Because I, on the other hand, tell the truth, YOU do not believe me.
John	43	8	47	Who of YOU convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it YOU do not believe me?
John	43	8	48	He that is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why YOU do not listen, because YOU are not from God.”
John	43	8	49	In answer the Jews said to him: “Do we not rightly say, You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”
John	43	8	50	Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and YOU dishonor me.
John	43	8	51	But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One that is seeking and judging.
John	43	8	52	Most truly I say to YOU, If anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.”
John	43	8	53	The Jews said to him: “Now we do know you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets; but you say, ‘If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.’
John	43	8	54	You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? Also, the prophets died. Who do you claim to be?”
John	43	8	55	Jesus answered: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, he who YOU say is YOUR God;
John	43	8	56	and yet YOU have not known him. But I know him. And if I said I do not know him I should be like YOU, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word.
John	43	8	57	Abraham YOUR father rejoiced greatly in the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”
John	43	8	58	Therefore the Jews said to him: “You are not yet fifty years old, and still you have seen Abraham?”
John	43	8	59	Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Before Abraham came into existence, I have been.”
John	43	8	60	Therefore they picked up stones to hurl them at him; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple.

John	43	9	1	Now as he was passing along he saw a man blind from birth.
John	43	9	2	And his disciples asked him: “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?”
John	43	9	3	Jesus answered: “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it was in order that the works of God might be made manifest in his case.
John	43	9	4	We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no man can work.
John	43	9	5	As long as I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”
John	43	9	6	After he said these things, he spit on the ground and made a clay with the saliva, and put his clay upon the man’s eyes
John	43	9	7	and said to him: “Go wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated ‘Sent forth’). And so he went off and washed, and came back seeing.
John	43	9	8	Therefore the neighbors and those who formerly used to see he was a beggar began to say: “This is the man that used to sit and beg, is it not?”
John	43	9	9	Some would say: “This is he.” Others would say: “Not at all, but he is like him.” The man would say: “I am he.”
John	43	9	10	Consequently they began to say to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?”
John	43	9	11	He answered: “The man called Jesus made a clay and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ I therefore went and washed and gained sight.”
John	43	9	12	At this they said to him: “Where is that man?” He said: “I do not know.”
John	43	9	13	They led the once-blind man himself to the Pharisees.
John	43	9	14	Incidentally it was Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
John	43	9	15	This time, therefore, the Pharisees also took up asking him how he gained sight. He said to them: “He put a clay upon my eyes, and I washed and have sight.”
John	43	9	16	Therefore some of the Pharisees began to say: “This is not a man from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.” Others began to say: “How can a man that is a sinner perform signs of that sort?” So there was a division among them.
John	43	9	17	Hence they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, seeing that he opened your eyes?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”
John	43	9	18	However, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had gained sight, until they called the parents of the man that gained sight.
John	43	9	19	And they asked them: “Is this YOUR son who YOU say was born blind? How, then, is it he sees at present?”
John	43	9	20	Then in answer his parents said: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
John	43	9	21	But how it is he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. ASK him. He is of age. He must speak for himself.”
John	43	9	22	His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews, for the Jews had already come to an agreement that, if anyone confessed him as Christ, he should get expelled from the synagogue.
John	43	9	23	This is why his parents said: “He is of age. QUESTION him.”
John	43	9	24	Therefore a second time they called the man that had been blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”
John	43	9	25	In turn he answered: “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, I see at present.”
John	43	9	26	Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
John	43	9	27	He answered them: “I told YOU already, and yet YOU did not listen. Why do YOU want to hear it again? YOU do not want to become his disciples also, do YOU?”
John	43	9	28	At this they reviled him and said: “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.
John	43	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where he is from.”
John	43	9	30	In answer the man said to them: “This certainly is a marvel, that YOU do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
John	43	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to this one.
John	43	9	32	From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.
John	43	9	33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing at all.”
John	43	9	34	In answer they said to him: “You were altogether born in sins, and yet are you teaching us?” And they threw him out!
John	43	9	35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and, on finding him, he said: “Are you putting faith in the Son of man?”
John	43	9	36	The man answered: “And who is he, sir, that I may put faith in him?”
John	43	9	37	Jesus said to him: “You have seen him and, besides, he that is speaking with you is that one.”
John	43	9	38	Then he said: “I do put faith in him, Lord.” And he did obeisance to him.
John	43	9	39	And Jesus said: “For this judgment I came into this world: that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”
John	43	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “We are not blind also, are we?”
John	43	9	41	Jesus said to them: “If YOU were blind, YOU would have no sin. But now YOU say, ‘We see.’ YOUR sin remains.”

John	43	10	1	“Most truly I say to YOU, He that does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs up some other place, that one is a thief and a plunderer.
John	43	10	2	But he that enters through the door is shepherd of the sheep.
John	43	10	3	The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
John	43	10	4	When he has got all his own out, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
John	43	10	5	A stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”
John	43	10	6	Jesus spoke this comparison to them; but they did not know what the things meant that he was speaking to them.
John	43	10	7	Therefore Jesus said again: “Most truly I say to YOU, I am the door of the sheep.
John	43	10	8	All those that have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers; but the sheep have not listened to them.
John	43	10	9	I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and find pasturage.
John	43	10	10	The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance.
John	43	10	11	I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.
John	43	10	12	The hired man, who is no shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong as his own, beholds the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them—
John	43	10	13	because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.
John	43	10	14	I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me,
John	43	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep.
John	43	10	16	“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.
John	43	10	17	This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my soul, in order that I may receive it again.
John	43	10	18	No man has taken it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative. I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. The commandment on this I received from my Father.”
John	43	10	19	Again a division resulted among the Jews because of these words.
John	43	10	20	Many of them were saying: “He has a demon and is mad. Why do YOU listen to him?”
John	43	10	21	Others would say: “These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people’s eyes, can it?”
John	43	10	22	At that time the festival of dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime,
John	43	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon.
John	43	10	24	Therefore the Jews encircled him and began to say to him: “How long are you to keep our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us outspokenly.”
John	43	10	25	Jesus answered them: “I told YOU, and yet YOU do not believe. The works that I am doing in the name of my Father, these bear witness about me.
John	43	10	26	But YOU do not believe, because YOU are none of my sheep.
John	43	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
John	43	10	28	And I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
John	43	10	29	What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father.
John	43	10	30	I and the Father are one.”
John	43	10	31	Once more the Jews lifted up stones to stone him.
John	43	10	32	Jesus replied to them: “I displayed to YOU many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are YOU stoning me?”
John	43	10	33	The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy, even because you, although being a man, make yourself a god.”
John	43	10	34	Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said: “YOU are gods”’?
John	43	10	35	If he called ‘gods’ those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified,
John	43	10	36	do YOU say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, I am God’s Son?
John	43	10	37	If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
John	43	10	38	But if I am doing them, even though YOU do not believe me, believe the works, in order that YOU may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.”
John	43	10	39	Therefore they tried again to seize him; but he got out of their reach.
John	43	10	40	So he went off again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.
John	43	10	41	And many people came to him, and they began saying: “John, indeed, did not perform a single sign, but as many things as John said about this man were all true.”
John	43	10	42	And many put faith in him there.

John	43	11	1	Now there was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and of Martha her sister.
John	43	11	2	It was, in fact, the Mary that greased the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John	43	11	3	Therefore his sisters dispatched word to him, saying: “Lord, see! the one for whom you have affection is sick.”
John	43	11	4	But when Jesus heard it he said: “This sickness is not with death as its object, but is for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
John	43	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John	43	11	6	However, when he heard that he was sick, then he actually remained two days in the place where he was.
John	43	11	7	Then after this he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Judea again.”
John	43	11	8	The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, just lately the Judeans were seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”
John	43	11	9	Jesus answered: “There are twelve hours of daylight, are there not? If anyone walks in daylight he does not bump against anything, because he sees the light of this world.
John	43	11	10	But if anyone walks in the night, he bumps against something, because the light is not in him.”
John	43	11	11	He said these things, and after this he said to them: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there to awaken him from sleep.”
John	43	11	12	Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has gone to rest, he will get well.”
John	43	11	13	Jesus had spoken, however, about his death. But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
John	43	11	14	At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: “Lazarus has died,
John	43	11	15	and I rejoice on YOUR account that I was not there, in order for YOU to believe. But let us go to him.”
John	43	11	16	Therefore Thomas, who was called The Twin, said to his fellow disciples: “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”
John	43	11	17	Consequently when Jesus arrived, he found he had already been four days in the memorial tomb.
John	43	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem at a distance of about two miles.
John	43	11	19	Accordingly many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.
John	43	11	20	Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him; but Mary kept sitting at home.
John	43	11	21	Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.
John	43	11	22	And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.”
John	43	11	23	Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”
John	43	11	24	Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”
John	43	11	25	Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life;
John	43	11	26	and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?”
John	43	11	27	She said to him: “Yes, Lord; I have believed that you are the Christ the Son of God, the One coming into the world.”
John	43	11	28	And when she had said this, she went off and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is present and is calling you.”
John	43	11	29	The latter, when she heard this, got up quickly and was on her way to him.
John	43	11	30	Jesus had not yet, in fact, come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him.
John	43	11	31	Therefore the Jews that were with her in the house and that were consoling her, on seeing Mary rise quickly and go out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the memorial tomb to weep there.
John	43	11	32	And so Mary, when she arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him, fell at his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
John	43	11	33	Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping and the Jews that came with her weeping, groaned in the spirit and became troubled;
John	43	11	34	and he said: “Where have YOU laid him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.”
John	43	11	35	Jesus gave way to tears.
John	43	11	36	Therefore the Jews began to say: “See, what affection he used to have for him!”
John	43	11	37	But some of them said: “Was not this man that opened the eyes of the blind man able to prevent this one from dying?”
John	43	11	38	Hence Jesus, after groaning again within himself, came to the memorial tomb. It was, in fact, a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
John	43	11	39	Jesus said: “TAKE the stone away.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: “Lord, by now he must smell, for it is four days.”
John	43	11	40	Jesus said to her: “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?”
John	43	11	41	Therefore they took the stone away. Now Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
John	43	11	42	True, I knew that you always hear me; but on account of the crowd standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that you sent me forth.”
John	43	11	43	And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: “Lazarus, come on out!”
John	43	11	44	The man that had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his countenance was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them: “Loose him and let him go.”
John	43	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews that had come to Mary and that beheld what he did put faith in him;
John	43	11	46	but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.
John	43	11	47	Consequently the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and began to say: “What are we to do, because this man performs many signs?
John	43	11	48	If we let him alone this way, they will all put faith in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
John	43	11	49	But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them: “YOU do not know anything at all,
John	43	11	50	and YOU do not reason out that it is to YOUR benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people and not for the whole nation to be destroyed.”
John	43	11	51	This, though, he did not say of his own originality; but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was destined to die for the nation,
John	43	11	52	and not for the nation only, but in order that the children of God who are scattered about he might also gather together in one.
John	43	11	53	Therefore from that day on they took counsel to kill him.
John	43	11	54	Hence Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews, but he departed from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with the disciples.
John	43	11	55	Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many people went up out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover in order to cleanse themselves ceremonially.
John	43	11	56	Therefore they went looking for Jesus and they would say to one another as they stood around in the temple: “What is YOUR opinion? That he will not come to the festival at all?”
John	43	11	57	As it was, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where he was, he should disclose it, in order that they might seize him.

John	43	12	1	Accordingly Jesus, six days before the passover, arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised up from the dead.
John	43	12	2	Therefore they spread an evening meal for him there, and Martha was ministering, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
John	43	12	3	Mary, therefore, took a pound of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very costly, and she greased the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair. The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil.
John	43	12	4	But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said:
John	43	12	5	“Why was it this perfumed oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor people?”
John	43	12	6	He said this, though, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to carry off the monies put in it.
John	43	12	7	Therefore Jesus said: “Let her alone, that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial.
John	43	12	8	For YOU have the poor always with YOU, but me YOU will not have always.”
John	43	12	9	Therefore a great crowd of the Jews got to know he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but also to see Lazarus, whom he raised up from the dead.
John	43	12	10	The chief priests now took counsel to kill Lazarus also,
John	43	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus.
John	43	12	12	The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival, on hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John	43	12	13	took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they began to shout: “Save, we pray you! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name, even the king of Israel!”
John	43	12	14	But when Jesus had found a young ass, he sat on it, just as it is written:
John	43	12	15	“Have no fear, daughter of Zion. Look! Your king is coming, seated upon an ass’s colt.”
John	43	12	16	These things his disciples took no note of at first, but when Jesus became glorified, then they called to mind that these things were written respecting him and that they did these things to him.
John	43	12	17	Accordingly the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the memorial tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness.
John	43	12	18	On this account the crowd, because they heard he had performed this sign, also met him.
John	43	12	19	Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “YOU observe YOU are getting absolutely nowhere. See! The world has gone after him.”
John	43	12	20	Now there were some Greeks among those that came up to worship at the festival.
John	43	12	21	These, therefore, approached Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they began to request him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
John	43	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.
John	43	12	23	But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
John	43	12	24	Most truly I say to YOU, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains just one grain; but if it dies, it then bears much fruit.
John	43	12	25	He that is fond of his soul destroys it, but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.
John	43	12	26	If anyone would minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am there my minister will be also. If anyone would minister to me, the Father will honor him.
John	43	12	27	Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me out of this hour. Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour.
John	43	12	28	Father, glorify your name.” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified it and will glorify it again.”
John	43	12	29	Hence the crowd that stood about and heard it began to say that it had thundered. Others began to say: “An angel has spoken to him.”
John	43	12	30	In answer Jesus said: “This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for YOUR sakes.
John	43	12	31	Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
John	43	12	32	And yet I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw men of all sorts to me.”
John	43	12	33	This he was really saying to signify what sort of death he was about to die.
John	43	12	34	Therefore the crowd answered him: “We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how is it you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?”
John	43	12	35	Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among YOU a little while longer. Walk while YOU have the light, so that darkness does not overpower YOU; and he that walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
John	43	12	36	While YOU have the light, exercise faith in the light, in order to become sons of light.” Jesus spoke these things and went off and hid from them.
John	43	12	37	But although he had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him,
John	43	12	38	so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said: “Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard by us? And as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed?”
John	43	12	39	The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said:
John	43	12	40	“He has blinded their eyes and he has made their hearts hard, that they should not see with their eyes and get the thought with their hearts and turn around and I should heal them.”
John	43	12	41	Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.
John	43	12	42	All the same, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess him, in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;
John	43	12	43	for they loved the glory of men more than even the glory of God.
John	43	12	44	However, Jesus cried out and said: “He that puts faith in me puts faith, not in me only, but in him also that sent me;
John	43	12	45	and he that beholds me beholds also him that sent me.
John	43	12	46	I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.
John	43	12	47	But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John	43	12	48	He that disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him. The word that I have spoken is what will judge him in the last day;
John	43	12	49	because I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak.
John	43	12	50	Also, I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore the things I speak, just as the Father has told me them, so I speak them.”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
John	43	13	1	Now, because he knew before the festival of the passover that his hour had come for him to move out of this world to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the end.
John	43	13	2	So, while the evening meal was going on, the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,
John	43	13	3	he, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came forth from God and was going to God,
John	43	13	4	got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And, taking a towel, he girded himself.
John	43	13	5	After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel with which he was girded.
John	43	13	6	And so he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?”
John	43	13	7	In answer Jesus said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand at present, but you will understand after these things.”
John	43	13	8	Peter said to him: “You will certainly never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him: “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”
John	43	13	9	Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”
John	43	13	10	Jesus said to him: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean. And YOU men are clean, but not all.”
John	43	13	11	He knew, indeed, the man betraying him. This is why he said: “Not all of YOU are clean.”
John	43	13	12	When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on and laid himself down at the table again, he said to them: “Do YOU know what I have done to YOU?
John	43	13	13	YOU address me, ‘Teacher,’ and, ‘Lord,’ and YOU speak rightly, for I am such.
John	43	13	14	Therefore, if I, although Lord and Teacher, washed YOUR feet, YOU also ought to wash the feet of one another.
John	43	13	15	For I set the pattern for YOU, that, just as I did to YOU, YOU should do also.
John	43	13	16	Most truly I say to YOU, A slave is not greater than his master, nor is one that is sent forth greater than the one that sent him.
John	43	13	17	If YOU know these things, happy YOU are if YOU do them.
John	43	13	18	I am not talking about all of YOU; I know the ones I have chosen. But it is in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’
John	43	13	19	From this moment on I am telling YOU before it occurs, in order that when it does occur YOU may believe that I am he.
John	43	13	20	Most truly I say to YOU, He that receives anyone I send receives me also. In turn he that receives me, receives also him that sent me.”
John	43	13	21	After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he bore witness and said: “Most truly I say to YOU, One of YOU will betray me.”
John	43	13	22	The disciples began to look at one another, being at a loss as to which one he was saying it about.
John	43	13	23	There was reclining in front of Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, and Jesus loved him.
John	43	13	24	Therefore Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him: “Tell who it is about whom he is saying it.”
John	43	13	25	So the latter leaned back upon the breast of Jesus and said to him: “Lord, who is it?”
John	43	13	26	Therefore Jesus answered: “It is that one to whom I shall give the morsel that I dip.” And so, having dipped the morsel, he took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
John	43	13	27	And after the morsel then Satan entered into the latter. Jesus, therefore, said to him: “What you are doing get done more quickly.”
John	43	13	28	However, none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose he said this to him.
John	43	13	29	Some, in fact, were imagining, since Judas was holding the money box, that Jesus was telling him: “Buy what things we need for the festival,” or that he should give something to the poor.
John	43	13	30	Therefore, after he received the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night.
John	43	13	31	Hence when he had gone out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in connection with him.
John	43	13	32	And God will himself glorify him, and he will glorify him immediately.
John	43	13	33	Little children, I am with YOU a little longer. YOU will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go YOU cannot come,’ I say also to YOU at present.
John	43	13	34	I am giving YOU a new commandment, that YOU love one another; just as I have loved YOU, that YOU also love one another.
John	43	13	35	By this all will know that YOU are my disciples, if YOU have love among yourselves.”
John	43	13	36	Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered: “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterwards.”
John	43	13	37	Peter said to him: “Lord, why is it I cannot follow you at present? I will surrender my soul in your behalf.”
John	43	13	38	Jesus answered: “Will you surrender your soul in my behalf? Most truly I say to you, A cock will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.”

John	43	14	1	“Do not let YOUR hearts be troubled. Exercise faith in God, exercise faith also in me.
John	43	14	2	In the house of my Father there are many abodes. Otherwise, I would have told YOU, because I am going my way to prepare a place for YOU.
John	43	14	3	Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for YOU, I am coming again and will receive YOU home to myself, that where I am YOU also may be.
John	43	14	4	And where I am going YOU know the way.”
John	43	14	5	Thomas said to him: “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How do we know the way?”
John	43	14	6	Jesus said to him: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
John	43	14	7	If YOU men had known me, YOU would have known my Father also; from this moment on YOU know him and have seen him.”
John	43	14	8	Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”
John	43	14	9	Jesus said to him: “Have I been with YOU men so long a time, and yet, Philip, you have not come to know me? He that has seen me has seen the Father also. How is it you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
John	43	14	10	Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me? The things I say to YOU men I do not speak of my own originality; but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works.
John	43	14	11	Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me; otherwise, believe on account of the works themselves.
John	43	14	12	Most truly I say to YOU, He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father.
John	43	14	13	Also, whatever it is that YOU ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son.
John	43	14	14	If YOU ask anything in my name, I will do it.
John	43	14	15	“If YOU love me, YOU will observe my commandments;
John	43	14	16	and I will request the Father and he will give YOU another helper to be with YOU forever,
John	43	14	17	the spirit of the truth, which the world cannot receive, because it neither beholds it nor knows it. YOU know it, because it remains with YOU and is in YOU.
John	43	14	18	I shall not leave YOU bereaved. I am coming to YOU.
John	43	14	19	A little longer and the world will behold me no more, but YOU will behold me, because I live and YOU will live.
John	43	14	20	In that day YOU will know that I am in union with my Father and YOU are in union with me and I am in union with YOU.
John	43	14	21	He that has my commandments and observes them, that one is he who loves me. In turn he that loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will plainly show myself to him.”
John	43	14	22	Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself plainly to us and not to the world?”
John	43	14	23	In answer Jesus said to him: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him, and we shall come to him and make our abode with him.
John	43	14	24	He that does not love me does not observe my words; and the word that YOU are hearing is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me.
John	43	14	25	“While remaining with YOU I have spoken these things to YOU.
John	43	14	26	But the helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach YOU all things and bring back to YOUR minds all the things I told YOU.
John	43	14	27	I leave YOU peace, I give YOU my peace. I do not give it to YOU the way that the world gives it. Do not let YOUR hearts be troubled nor let them shrink for fear.
John	43	14	28	YOU heard that I said to YOU, I am going away and I am coming back to YOU. If YOU loved me, YOU would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.
John	43	14	29	So now I have told YOU before it occurs, in order that, when it does occur, YOU may believe.
John	43	14	30	I shall not speak much with YOU anymore, for the ruler of the world is coming. And he has no hold on me,
John	43	14	31	but, in order for the world to know that I love the Father, even as the Father has given me commandment to do, so I am doing. Get up, let us go from here.

John	43	15	1	“I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.
John	43	15	2	Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.
John	43	15	3	YOU are already clean because of the word that I have spoken to YOU.
John	43	15	4	Remain in union with me, and I in union with YOU. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, in the same way neither can YOU, unless YOU remain in union with me.
John	43	15	5	I am the vine, YOU are the branches. He that remains in union with me, and I in union with him, this one bears much fruit; because apart from me YOU can do nothing at all.
John	43	15	6	If anyone does not remain in union with me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and men gather those branches up and pitch them into the fire and they are burned.
John	43	15	7	If YOU remain in union with me and my sayings remain in YOU, ask whatever YOU wish and it will take place for YOU.
John	43	15	8	My Father is glorified in this, that YOU keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.
John	43	15	9	Just as the Father has loved me and I have loved YOU, remain in my love.
John	43	15	10	If YOU observe my commandments, YOU will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.
John	43	15	11	“These things I have spoken to YOU, that my joy may be in YOU and YOUR joy may be made full.
John	43	15	12	This is my commandment, that YOU love one another just as I have loved YOU.
John	43	15	13	No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.
John	43	15	14	YOU are my friends if YOU do what I am commanding YOU.
John	43	15	15	I no longer call YOU slaves, because a slave does not know what his master does. But I have called YOU friends, because all the things I have heard from my Father I have made known to YOU.
John	43	15	16	YOU did not choose me, but I chose YOU, and I appointed YOU to go on and keep bearing fruit and that YOUR fruit should remain; in order that no matter what YOU ask the Father in my name he might give it to YOU.
John	43	15	17	“These things I command YOU, that YOU love one another.
John	43	15	18	If the world hates YOU, YOU know that it has hated me before it hated YOU.
John	43	15	19	If YOU were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because YOU are no part of the world, but I have chosen YOU out of the world, on this account the world hates YOU.
John	43	15	20	Bear in mind the word I said to YOU, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute YOU also; if they have observed my word, they will observe YOURS also.
John	43	15	21	But they will do all these things against YOU on account of my name, because they do not know him that sent me.
John	43	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John	43	15	23	He that hates me hates also my Father.
John	43	15	24	If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen and hated me as well as my Father.
John	43	15	25	But it is that the word written in their Law may be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without cause.’
John	43	15	26	When the helper arrives that I will send YOU from the Father, the spirit of the truth, which proceeds from the Father, that one will bear witness about me;
John	43	15	27	and YOU, in turn, are to bear witness, because YOU have been with me from when I began.

John	43	16	1	“I have spoken these things to YOU that YOU may not be stumbled.
John	43	16	2	Men will expel YOU from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone that kills YOU will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God.
John	43	16	3	But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me.
John	43	16	4	Nevertheless, I have spoken these things to YOU that, when the hour for them arrives, YOU may remember I told them to YOU. “These things, however, I did not tell YOU at first, because I was with YOU.
John	43	16	5	But now I am going to him that sent me, and yet not one of YOU asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
John	43	16	6	But because I have spoken these things to YOU grief has filled YOUR hearts.
John	43	16	7	Nevertheless, I am telling YOU the truth, It is for YOUR benefit I am going away. For if I do not go away, the helper will by no means come to YOU; but if I do go my way, I will send him to YOU.
John	43	16	8	And when that one arrives he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:
John	43	16	9	in the first place, concerning sin, because they are not exercising faith in me;
John	43	16	10	then concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and YOU will behold me no longer;
John	43	16	11	then concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
John	43	16	12	“I have many things yet to say to YOU, but YOU are not able to bear them at present.
John	43	16	13	However, when that one arrives, the spirit of the truth, he will guide YOU into all the truth, for he will not speak of his own impulse, but what things he hears he will speak, and he will declare to YOU the things coming.
John	43	16	14	That one will glorify me, because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to YOU.
John	43	16	15	All the things that the Father has are mine. That is why I said he receives from what is mine and declares it to YOU.
John	43	16	16	In a little while YOU will behold me no longer, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me.”
John	43	16	17	Therefore some of his disciples said to one another: “What does this mean that he says to us, ‘In a little while YOU will not behold me, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me,’ and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”
John	43	16	18	Hence they were saying: “What does this mean that he says, ‘a little while’? We do not know what he is talking about.”
John	43	16	19	Jesus knew they were wanting to question him, so he said to them: “Are YOU inquiring among yourselves over this, because I said, In a little while YOU will not behold me, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me?
John	43	16	20	Most truly I say to YOU, YOU will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; YOU will be grieved, but YOUR grief will be turned into joy.
John	43	16	21	A woman, when she is giving birth, has grief, because her hour has arrived; but when she has brought forth the young child, she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.
John	43	16	22	YOU also, therefore, are now, indeed, having grief; but I shall see YOU again and YOUR hearts will rejoice, and YOUR joy no one will take from YOU.
John	43	16	23	And in that day YOU will ask me no question at all. Most truly I say to YOU, If YOU ask the Father for anything he will give it to YOU in my name.
John	43	16	24	Until this present time YOU have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask and YOU will receive, that YOUR joy may be made full.
John	43	16	25	“I have spoken these things to YOU in comparisons. The hour is coming when I will speak to YOU no more in comparisons, but I will report to YOU with plainness concerning the Father.
John	43	16	26	In that day YOU will ask in my name, and I do not say to YOU that I shall make request of the Father concerning YOU.
John	43	16	27	For the Father himself has affection for YOU, because YOU have had affection for me and have believed that I came out as the Father’s representative.
John	43	16	28	I came out from the Father and have come into the world. Further, I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father.”
John	43	16	29	His disciples said: “See! Now you are speaking with plainness, and are uttering no comparison.
John	43	16	30	Now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you. By this we believe that you came out from God.”
John	43	16	31	Jesus answered them: “Do YOU believe at present?
John	43	16	32	Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when YOU will be scattered each one to his own house and YOU will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
John	43	16	33	I have said these things to YOU that by means of me YOU may have peace. In the world YOU are having tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.”

John	43	17	1	Jesus spoke these things, and, raising his eyes to heaven, he said: “Father, the hour has come; glorify your son, that your son may glorify you,
John	43	17	2	according as you have given him authority over all flesh, that, as regards the whole number whom you have given him, he may give them everlasting life.
John	43	17	3	This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.
John	43	17	4	I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do.
John	43	17	5	So now you, Father, glorify me alongside yourself with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.
John	43	17	6	“I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have observed your word.
John	43	17	7	They have now come to know that all the things you gave me are from you;
John	43	17	8	because the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and have certainly come to know that I came out as your representative, and they have believed that you sent me forth.
John	43	17	9	I make request concerning them; I make request, not concerning the world, but concerning those you have given me; because they are yours,
John	43	17	10	and all my things are yours and yours are mine, and I have been glorified among them.
John	43	17	11	“Also, I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are.
John	43	17	12	When I was with them I used to watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me; and I have kept them, and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled.
John	43	17	13	But now I am coming to you, and I am speaking these things in the world in order that they may have my joy in themselves to the full.
John	43	17	14	I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.
John	43	17	15	“I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.
John	43	17	16	They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.
John	43	17	17	Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.
John	43	17	18	Just as you sent me forth into the world, I also sent them forth into the world.
John	43	17	19	And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf, that they also may be sanctified by means of truth.
John	43	17	20	“I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word;
John	43	17	21	in order that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, in order that the world may believe that you sent me forth.
John	43	17	22	Also, I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one.
John	43	17	23	I in union with them and you in union with me, in order that they may be perfected into one, that the world may have the knowledge that you sent me forth and that you loved them just as you loved me.
John	43	17	24	Father, as to what you have given me, I wish that, where I am, they also may be with me, in order to behold my glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the founding of the world.
John	43	17	25	Righteous Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you; but I have come to know you, and these have come to know that you sent me forth.
John	43	17	26	And I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.”

John	43	18	1	Having said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the winter torrent of Kidron to where there was a garden, and he and his disciples entered into it.
John	43	18	2	Now Judas, his betrayer, also knew the place, because Jesus had many times met there with his disciples.
John	43	18	3	Therefore Judas took the soldier band and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons.
John	43	18	4	Jesus, therefore, knowing all the things coming upon him, went forth and said to them: “Whom are YOU looking for?”
John	43	18	5	They answered him: “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them: “I am he.” Now Judas, his betrayer, was also standing with them.
John	43	18	6	However, when he said to them: “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
John	43	18	7	Therefore he asked them again: “Whom are YOU looking for?” They said: “Jesus the Nazarene.”
John	43	18	8	Jesus answered: “I told YOU I am he. If, therefore, it is I YOU are looking for, let these go”;
John	43	18	9	in order that the word might be fulfilled which he said: “Of those whom you have given me I have not lost a single one.”
John	43	18	10	Then Simon Peter, as he had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut his right ear off. The name of the slave was Malchus.
John	43	18	11	Jesus, however, said to Peter: “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not by all means drink it?”
John	43	18	12	Then the soldier band and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,
John	43	18	13	and they led him first to Annas; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John	43	18	14	Caiaphas was, in fact, the one that counseled the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people.
John	43	18	15	Now Simon Peter as well as another disciple was following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
John	43	18	16	but Peter was standing outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
John	43	18	17	The servant girl, the doorkeeper, then said to Peter: “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said: “I am not.”
John	43	18	18	Now the slaves and the officers were standing about, as they had built a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.
John	43	18	19	And so the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
John	43	18	20	Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.
John	43	18	21	Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.”
John	43	18	22	After he said these things, one of the officers that was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said: “Is that the way you answer the chief priest?”
John	43	18	23	Jesus answered him: “If I spoke wrongly, bear witness concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit me?”
John	43	18	24	Then Annas sent him away bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John	43	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said: “I am not.”
John	43	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said: “I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?”
John	43	18	27	However, Peter denied it again; and immediately a cock crowed.
John	43	18	28	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. It was now early in the day. But they themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace, that they might not get defiled but might eat the passover.
John	43	18	29	Therefore Pilate came outside to them and said: “What accusation do YOU bring against this man?”
John	43	18	30	In answer they said to him: “If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”
John	43	18	31	Hence Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and judge him according to YOUR law.” The Jews said to him: “It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.”
John	43	18	32	This, in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said to signify what sort of death he was destined to die.
John	43	18	33	So Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”
John	43	18	34	Jesus answered: “Is it of your own originality that you say this, or did others tell you about me?”
John	43	18	35	Pilate answered: “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you up to me. What did you do?”
John	43	18	36	Jesus answered: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.”
John	43	18	37	Therefore Pilate said to him: “Well, then, are you a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone that is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.”
John	43	18	38	Pilate said to him: “What is truth?” And after saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I find no fault in him.
John	43	18	39	Moreover, YOU have a custom that I should release a man to YOU at the passover. Do YOU, therefore, wish me to release to YOU the king of the Jews?”
John	43	18	40	Then they shouted again, saying: “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
John	43	19	1	At that time, therefore, Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.
John	43	19	2	And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him with a purple outer garment;
John	43	19	3	and they began coming up to him and saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!” Also, they would give him slaps in the face.
John	43	19	4	And Pilate went outside again and said to them: “See! I bring him outside to YOU in order for YOU to know I find no fault in him.”
John	43	19	5	Accordingly Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple outer garment. And he said to them: “Look! The man!”
John	43	19	6	However, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying: “Impale him! Impale him!” Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and impale him, for I do not find any fault in him.”
John	43	19	7	The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself God’s son.”
John	43	19	8	When, therefore, Pilate heard this saying, he became more fearful;
John	43	19	9	and he entered into the governor’s palace again and said to Jesus: “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
John	43	19	10	Hence Pilate said to him: “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know I have authority to release you and I have authority to impale you?”
John	43	19	11	Jesus answered him: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man that handed me over to you has greater sin.”
John	43	19	12	For this reason Pilate kept on seeking how to release him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Every man making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
John	43	19	13	Therefore Pilate, after hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called The Stone Pavement, but, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John	43	19	14	Now it was preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: “See! YOUR king!”
John	43	19	15	However, they shouted: “Take him away! Take him away! Impale him!” Pilate said to them: “Shall I impale YOUR king?” The chief priests answered: “We have no king but Caesar.”
John	43	19	16	At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled. Then they took charge of Jesus.
John	43	19	17	And, bearing the torture stake for himself, he went out to the so-called Skull Place, which is called Golgotha in Hebrew;
John	43	19	18	and there they impaled him, and two other men with him, one on this side and one on that, but Jesus in the middle.
John	43	19	19	Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the torture stake. It was written: “Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.”
John	43	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.
John	43	19	21	However, the chief priests of the Jews began to say to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”
John	43	19	22	Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”
John	43	19	23	Now when the soldiers had impaled Jesus, they took his outer garments and made four parts, for each soldier a part, and the inner garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from the top throughout its length.
John	43	19	24	Therefore they said to one another: “Let us not tear it, but let us determine by lots over it whose it will be.” This was that the scripture might be fulfilled: “They apportioned my outer garments among themselves, and upon my apparel they cast lots.” And so the soldiers really did these things.
John	43	19	25	By the torture stake of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and the sister of his mother; Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John	43	19	26	Therefore Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!”
John	43	19	27	Next he said to the disciple: “See! Your mother!” And from that hour on the disciple took her to his own home.
John	43	19	28	After this, when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished, in order that the scripture might be accomplished he said: “I am thirsty.”
John	43	19	29	A vessel was sitting there full of sour wine. Therefore they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a hyssop stalk and brought it to his mouth.
John	43	19	30	When, now, he had received the sour wine, Jesus said: “It has been accomplished!” and, bowing his head, he delivered up his spirit.
John	43	19	31	Then the Jews, since it was Preparation, in order that the bodies might not remain upon the torture stakes on the Sabbath, (for the day of that Sabbath was a great one,) requested Pilate to have their legs broken and the bodies taken away.
John	43	19	32	The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man that had been impaled with him.
John	43	19	33	But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
John	43	19	34	Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
John	43	19	35	And he that has seen it has borne witness, and his witness is true, and that man knows he tells true things, in order that YOU also may believe.
John	43	19	36	In fact, these things took place in order for the scripture to be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be crushed.”
John	43	19	37	And, again, a different scripture says: “They will look to the One whom they pierced.”
John	43	19	38	Now after these things Joseph from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one out of his fear of the Jews, requested Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body away.
John	43	19	39	Nicodemus also, the man that came to him in the night the first time, came bringing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds of it.
John	43	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it up with bandages with the spices, just the way the Jews have the custom of preparing for burial.
John	43	19	41	Incidentally, at the place where he was impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a new memorial tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.
John	43	19	42	There, then, on account of the preparation of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the memorial tomb was nearby.

John	43	20	1	On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the memorial tomb early, while there was still darkness, and she beheld the stone already taken away from the memorial tomb.
John	43	20	2	Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, for whom Jesus had affection, and she said to them: “They have taken away the Lord out of the memorial tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”
John	43	20	3	Then Peter and the other disciple went out and started for the memorial tomb.
John	43	20	4	Yes, the two together began to run; but the other disciple ran ahead of Peter with greater speed and reached the memorial tomb first.
John	43	20	5	And, stooping forward, he beheld the bandages lying, yet he did not go in.
John	43	20	6	Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he entered into the memorial tomb. And he viewed the bandages lying,
John	43	20	7	also the cloth that had been upon his head not lying with the bandages but separately rolled up in one place.
John	43	20	8	At that time, therefore, the other disciple who had reached the memorial tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.
John	43	20	9	For they did not yet discern the scripture that he must rise from the dead.
John	43	20	10	And so the disciples went back to their homes.
John	43	20	11	Mary, however, kept standing outside near the memorial tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she stooped forward to look into the memorial tomb
John	43	20	12	and she viewed two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.
John	43	20	13	And they said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them: “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have laid him.”
John	43	20	14	After saying these things, she turned back and viewed Jesus standing, but she did not discern it was Jesus.
John	43	20	15	Jesus said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She, imagining it was the gardener, said to him: “Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
John	43	20	16	Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Upon turning around, she said to him, in Hebrew: “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher!”)
John	43	20	17	Jesus said to her: “Stop clinging to me. For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But be on your way to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and YOUR Father and to my God and YOUR God.’”
John	43	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!” and that he said these things to her.
John	43	20	19	Therefore, when it was late on that day, the first of the week, and, although the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them: “May YOU have peace.”
John	43	20	20	And after he said this he showed them both his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.
John	43	20	21	Jesus, therefore, said to them again: “May YOU have peace. Just as the Father has sent me forth, I also am sending YOU.”
John	43	20	22	And after he said this he blew upon them and said to them: “Receive holy spirit.
John	43	20	23	If YOU forgive the sins of any persons, they stand forgiven to them; if YOU retain those of any persons, they stand retained.”
John	43	20	24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called The Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
John	43	20	25	Consequently the other disciples would say to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”
John	43	20	26	Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst and said: “May YOU have peace.”
John	43	20	27	Next he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop being unbelieving but become believing.”
John	43	20	28	In answer Thomas said to him: “My Lord and my God!”
John	43	20	29	Jesus said to him: “Because you have seen me have you believed? Happy are those who do not see and yet believe.”
John	43	20	30	To be sure, Jesus performed many other signs also before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll.
John	43	20	31	But these have been written down that YOU may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, YOU may have life by means of his name.

John	43	21	1	After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; but he made the manifestation in this way.
John	43	21	2	There were in company Simon Peter and Thomas, who was called The Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples.
John	43	21	3	Simon Peter said to them: “I am going fishing.” They said to him: “We also are coming with you.” Out they went and got aboard the boat, but during that night they caught nothing.
John	43	21	4	However, just as it was getting to be morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not, of course, discern that it was Jesus.
John	43	21	5	Then Jesus said to them: “Young children, YOU do not have anything to eat, do YOU?” They answered “No!” to him.
John	43	21	6	He said to them: “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and YOU will find some.” Then they cast it, but they were no longer able to draw it in because of the multitude of the fishes.
John	43	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus used to love said to Peter: “It is the Lord!” Hence Simon Peter, upon hearing that it was the Lord, girded about himself his top garment, for he was naked, and plunged into the sea.
John	43	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not a long way from land, only about three hundred feet away, dragging the net of fishes.
John	43	21	9	However, when they disembarked onto land they beheld lying there a charcoal fire and fish lying upon it and bread.
John	43	21	10	Jesus said to them: “Bring some of the fish YOU just now caught.”
John	43	21	11	Simon Peter, therefore, went on board and drew the net to land full of big fishes, one hundred and fifty-three of them. But although there were so many the net did not burst.
John	43	21	12	Jesus said to them: “Come, take YOUR breakfast.” Not one of the disciples had the courage to inquire of him: “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.
John	43	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
John	43	21	14	This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after his being raised up from the dead.
John	43	21	15	When, now, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Feed my lambs.”
John	43	21	16	Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Shepherd my little sheep.”
John	43	21	17	He said to him the third time: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” Peter became grieved that he said to him the third time: “Do you have affection for me?” So he said to him: “Lord, you know all things; you are aware that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him: “Feed my little sheep.
John	43	21	18	Most truly I say to you, When you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another man will gird you and bear you where you do not wish.”
John	43	21	19	This he said to signify by what sort of death he would glorify God. So, when he had said this, he said to him: “Continue following me.”
John	43	21	20	Upon turning about Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus used to love following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back upon his breast and said: “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”
John	43	21	21	Accordingly, when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this man do?”
John	43	21	22	Jesus said to him: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.”
John	43	21	23	In consequence, this saying went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?”
John	43	21	24	This is the disciple that bears witness about these things and that wrote these things, and we know that the witness he gives is true.
John	43	21	25	There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.

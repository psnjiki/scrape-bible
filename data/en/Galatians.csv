Galatians	48	1	1	Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead,
Galatians	48	1	2	and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Galatia:
Galatians	48	1	3	May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Galatians	48	1	4	He gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from the present wicked system of things according to the will of our God and Father,
Galatians	48	1	5	to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians	48	1	6	I marvel that YOU are being so quickly removed from the One who called YOU with Christ’s undeserved kindness over to another sort of good news.
Galatians	48	1	7	But it is not another; only there are certain ones who are causing YOU trouble and wanting to pervert the good news about the Christ.
Galatians	48	1	8	However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to YOU as good news something beyond what we declared to YOU as good news, let him be accursed.
Galatians	48	1	9	As we have said above, I also now say again, Whoever it is that is declaring to YOU as good news something beyond what YOU accepted, let him be accursed.
Galatians	48	1	10	Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave.
Galatians	48	1	11	For I put YOU on notice, brothers, that the good news which was declared by me as good news is not something human;
Galatians	48	1	12	for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, except through revelation by Jesus Christ.
Galatians	48	1	13	YOU, of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Judaism, that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it,
Galatians	48	1	14	and I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age in my race, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians	48	1	15	But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, thought good
Galatians	48	1	16	to reveal his Son in connection with me, that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not go at once into conference with flesh and blood.
Galatians	48	1	17	Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles previous to me, but I went off into Arabia, and I came back again to Damascus.
Galatians	48	1	18	Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.
Galatians	48	1	19	But I saw no one else of the apostles, only James the brother of the Lord.
Galatians	48	1	20	Now as to the things I am writing YOU, look! in the sight of God, I am not lying.
Galatians	48	1	21	After that I went into the regions of Syria and of Cilicia.
Galatians	48	1	22	But I was unknown by face to the congregations of Judea that were in union with Christ;
Galatians	48	1	23	they only used to hear: “The man that formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith which he formerly devastated.”
Galatians	48	1	24	So they began glorifying God because of me.

Galatians	48	2	1	Then after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus along with me.
Galatians	48	2	2	But I went up as a result of a revelation. And I laid before them the good news which I am preaching among the nations, privately, however, before those who were outstanding men, for fear that somehow I was running or had run in vain.
Galatians	48	2	3	Nevertheless, not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek.
Galatians	48	2	4	But because of the false brothers brought in quietly, who sneaked in to spy upon our freedom which we have in union with Christ Jesus, that they might completely enslave us—
Galatians	48	2	5	to these we did not yield by way of submission, no, not for an hour, in order that the truth of the good news might continue with YOU.
Galatians	48	2	6	But on the part of those who seemed to be something—whatever sort of men they formerly were makes no difference to me—God does not go by a man’s outward appearance—to me, in fact, those outstanding men imparted nothing new.
Galatians	48	2	7	But, on the contrary, when they saw that I had entrusted to me the good news for those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter had it for those who are circumcised—
Galatians	48	2	8	for He who gave Peter powers necessary for an apostleship to those who are circumcised gave powers also to me for those who are of the nations;
Galatians	48	2	9	yes, when they came to know the undeserved kindness that was given me, James and Cephas and John, the ones who seemed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of sharing together, that we should go to the nations, but they to those who are circumcised.
Galatians	48	2	10	Only we should keep the poor in mind. This very thing I have also earnestly endeavored to do.
Galatians	48	2	11	However, when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians	48	2	12	For before the arrival of certain men from James, he used to eat with people of the nations; but when they arrived, he went withdrawing and separating himself, in fear of those of the circumcised class.
Galatians	48	2	13	The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense, so that even Barnabas was led along with them in their pretense.
Galatians	48	2	14	But when I saw they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all: “If you, though you are a Jew, live as the nations do, and not as Jews do, how is it that you are compelling people of the nations to live according to Jewish practice?”
Galatians	48	2	15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners from the nations,
Galatians	48	2	16	knowing as we do that a man is declared righteous, not due to works of law, but only through faith toward Christ Jesus, even we have put our faith in Christ Jesus, that we may be declared righteous due to faith toward Christ, and not due to works of law, because due to works of law no flesh will be declared righteous.
Galatians	48	2	17	Now if we, in seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ, have also ourselves been found sinners, is Christ in reality sin’s minister? May that never happen!
Galatians	48	2	18	For if the very things that I once threw down I build up again, I demonstrate myself to be a transgressor.
Galatians	48	2	19	As for me, through law I died toward law, that I might become alive toward God.
Galatians	48	2	20	I am impaled along with Christ. It is no longer I that live, but it is Christ that is living in union with me. Indeed, the life that I now live in flesh I live by the faith that is toward the Son of God, who loved me and handed himself over for me.
Galatians	48	2	21	I do not shove aside the undeserved kindness of God; for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing.

Galatians	48	3	1	O senseless Galatians, who is it that brought YOU under evil influence, YOU before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed impaled?
Galatians	48	3	2	This alone I want to learn from YOU: Did YOU receive the spirit due to works of law or due to a hearing by faith?
Galatians	48	3	3	Are YOU so senseless? After starting in spirit are YOU now being completed in flesh?
Galatians	48	3	4	Did YOU undergo so many sufferings to no purpose? If it really was to no purpose.
Galatians	48	3	5	He, therefore, who supplies YOU the spirit and performs powerful works among YOU, does he do it owing to works of law or owing to a hearing by faith?
Galatians	48	3	6	Just as Abraham “put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
Galatians	48	3	7	Surely YOU know that those who adhere to faith are the ones who are sons of Abraham.
Galatians	48	3	8	Now the Scripture, seeing in advance that God would declare people of the nations righteous due to faith, declared the good news beforehand to Abraham, namely: “By means of you all the nations will be blessed.”
Galatians	48	3	9	Consequently those who adhere to faith are being blessed together with faithful Abraham.
Galatians	48	3	10	For all those who depend upon works of law are under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is every one that does not continue in all the things written in the scroll of the Law in order to do them.”
Galatians	48	3	11	Moreover, that by law no one is declared righteous with God is evident, because “the righteous one will live by reason of faith.”
Galatians	48	3	12	Now the Law does not adhere to faith, but “he that does them shall live by means of them.”
Galatians	48	3	13	Christ by purchase released us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: “Accursed is every man hanged upon a stake.”
Galatians	48	3	14	The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham might come to be by means of Jesus Christ for the nations, that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith.
Galatians	48	3	15	Brothers, I speak with a human illustration: A validated covenant, though it is a man’s, no one sets aside or attaches additions to it.
Galatians	48	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It says, not: “And to seeds,” as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one: “And to your seed,” who is Christ.
Galatians	48	3	17	Further, I say this: As to the covenant previously validated by God, the Law that has come into being four hundred and thirty years later does not invalidate it, so as to abolish the promise.
Galatians	48	3	18	For if the inheritance is due to law, it is no longer due to promise; whereas God has kindly given it to Abraham through a promise.
Galatians	48	3	19	Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the seed should arrive to whom the promise had been made; and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator.
Galatians	48	3	20	Now there is no mediator where only one person is concerned, but God is only one.
Galatians	48	3	21	Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? May that never happen! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, righteousness would actually have been by means of law.
Galatians	48	3	22	But the Scripture delivered up all things together to the custody of sin, that the promise resulting from faith toward Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith.
Galatians	48	3	23	However, before the faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being delivered up together into custody, looking to the faith that was destined to be revealed.
Galatians	48	3	24	Consequently the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith.
Galatians	48	3	25	But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a tutor.
Galatians	48	3	26	YOU are all, in fact, sons of God through YOUR faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians	48	3	27	For all of YOU who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians	48	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for YOU are all one person in union with Christ Jesus.
Galatians	48	3	29	Moreover, if YOU belong to Christ, YOU are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Galatians	48	4	1	Now I say that as long as the heir is a babe he does not differ at all from a slave, lord of all things though he is,
Galatians	48	4	2	but he is under men in charge and under stewards until the day his father appointed beforehand.
Galatians	48	4	3	Likewise we also, when we were babes, continued enslaved by the elementary things belonging to the world.
Galatians	48	4	4	But when the full limit of the time arrived, God sent forth his Son, who came to be out of a woman and who came to be under law,
Galatians	48	4	5	that he might release by purchase those under law, that we, in turn, might receive the adoption as sons.
Galatians	48	4	6	Now because YOU are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts and it cries out: “Abba, Father!”
Galatians	48	4	7	So, then, you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, also an heir through God.
Galatians	48	4	8	Nevertheless, when YOU did not know God, then it was that YOU slaved for those who by nature are not gods.
Galatians	48	4	9	But now that YOU have come to know God, or rather now that YOU have come to be known by God, how is it that YOU are turning back again to the weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again?
Galatians	48	4	10	YOU are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years.
Galatians	48	4	11	I fear for YOU, that somehow I have toiled to no purpose respecting YOU.
Galatians	48	4	12	Brothers, I beg YOU, Become as I am, because I used to be also as YOU are. YOU did me no wrong.
Galatians	48	4	13	But YOU know that it was through a sickness of my flesh I declared the good news to YOU the first time.
Galatians	48	4	14	And what was a trial to YOU in my flesh, YOU did not treat with contempt or spit at in disgust; but YOU received me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.
Galatians	48	4	15	Where, then, is that happiness YOU had? For I bear YOU witness that, if it had been possible, YOU would have gouged out YOUR eyes and given them to me.
Galatians	48	4	16	Well, then, have I become YOUR enemy because I tell YOU the truth?
Galatians	48	4	17	They zealously seek YOU, not in a fine way, but they want to shut YOU off from me, that YOU may zealously seek them.
Galatians	48	4	18	However, it is fine for YOU to be zealously sought for in a fine cause at all times, and not only when I am present with YOU,
Galatians	48	4	19	my little children, with whom I am again in childbirth pains until Christ is formed in YOU.
Galatians	48	4	20	But I could wish to be present with YOU just now and to speak in a different way, because I am perplexed over YOU.
Galatians	48	4	21	Tell me, YOU who want to be under law, Do YOU not hear the Law?
Galatians	48	4	22	For example, it is written that Abraham acquired two sons, one by the servant girl and one by the free woman;
Galatians	48	4	23	but the one by the servant girl was actually born in the manner of flesh, the other by the free woman through a promise.
Galatians	48	4	24	These things stand as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which brings forth children for slavery, and which is Hagar.
Galatians	48	4	25	Now this Hagar means Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians	48	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
Galatians	48	4	27	For it is written: “Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break out and cry aloud, you woman who does not have childbirth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.”
Galatians	48	4	28	Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was.
Galatians	48	4	29	But just as then the one born in the manner of flesh began persecuting the one born in the manner of spirit, so also now.
Galatians	48	4	30	Nevertheless, what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the servant girl and her son, for by no means shall the son of the servant girl be an heir with the son of the free woman.”
Galatians	48	4	31	Wherefore, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman.

Galatians	48	5	1	For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.
Galatians	48	5	2	See! I, Paul, am telling YOU that if YOU become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to YOU.
Galatians	48	5	3	Moreover, I bear witness again to every man getting circumcised that he is under obligation to perform the whole Law.
Galatians	48	5	4	YOU are parted from Christ, whoever YOU are that try to be declared righteous by means of law; YOU have fallen away from his undeserved kindness.
Galatians	48	5	5	For our part we by spirit are eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness as a result of faith.
Galatians	48	5	6	For as regards Christ Jesus neither circumcision is of any value nor is uncircumcision, but faith operating through love is.
Galatians	48	5	7	YOU were running well. Who hindered YOU from keeping on obeying the truth?
Galatians	48	5	8	This sort of persuasion is not from the One calling YOU.
Galatians	48	5	9	A little leaven ferments the whole lump.
Galatians	48	5	10	I am confident about YOU who are in union with the Lord that YOU will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing YOU trouble will bear his judgment, no matter who he may be.
Galatians	48	5	11	As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then, indeed, the stumbling block of the torture stake has been abolished.
Galatians	48	5	12	I wish the men who are trying to overturn YOU would even get themselves emasculated.
Galatians	48	5	13	YOU were, of course, called for freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an inducement for the flesh, but through love slave for one another.
Galatians	48	5	14	For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
Galatians	48	5	15	If, though, YOU keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that YOU do not get annihilated by one another.
Galatians	48	5	16	But I say, Keep walking by spirit and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all.
Galatians	48	5	17	For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do.
Galatians	48	5	18	Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, YOU are not under law.
Galatians	48	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct,
Galatians	48	5	20	idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects,
Galatians	48	5	21	envies, drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these. As to these things I am forewarning YOU, the same way as I did forewarn YOU, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.
Galatians	48	5	22	On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
Galatians	48	5	23	mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.
Galatians	48	5	24	Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled the flesh together with its passions and desires.
Galatians	48	5	25	If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit.
Galatians	48	5	26	Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Galatians	48	6	1	Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, YOU who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted.
Galatians	48	6	2	Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ.
Galatians	48	6	3	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving his own mind.
Galatians	48	6	4	But let each one prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.
Galatians	48	6	5	For each one will carry his own load.
Galatians	48	6	6	Moreover, let anyone who is being orally taught the word share in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching.
Galatians	48	6	7	Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap;
Galatians	48	6	8	because he who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but he who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.
Galatians	48	6	9	So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.
Galatians	48	6	10	Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.
Galatians	48	6	11	SEE with what large letters I have written YOU with my own hand.
Galatians	48	6	12	All those who want to make a pleasing appearance in the flesh are the ones that try to compel YOU to get circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the torture stake of the Christ, Jesus.
Galatians	48	6	13	For not even do those who are getting circumcised keep the Law themselves, but they want YOU to be circumcised that they may have cause for boasting in YOUR flesh.
Galatians	48	6	14	Never may it occur that I should boast, except in the torture stake of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been impaled to me and I to the world.
Galatians	48	6	15	For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation is something.
Galatians	48	6	16	And all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.
Galatians	48	6	17	Henceforth let no one be making trouble for me, for I am carrying on my body the brand marks of a slave of Jesus.
Galatians	48	6	18	The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit YOU show, brothers. Amen.

Acts	44	1	1	The first account, O Theophilus, I composed about all the things Jesus started both to do and to teach,
Acts	44	1	2	until the day that he was taken up, after he had given commandment through holy spirit to the apostles whom he chose.
Acts	44	1	3	To these also by many positive proofs he showed himself alive after he had suffered, being seen by them throughout forty days and telling the things about the kingdom of God.
Acts	44	1	4	And while he was meeting with them he gave them the orders: “Do not withdraw from Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised, about which YOU heard from me;
Acts	44	1	5	because John, indeed, baptized with water, but YOU will be baptized in holy spirit not many days after this.”
Acts	44	1	6	When, now, they had assembled, they went asking him: “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”
Acts	44	1	7	He said to them: “It does not belong to YOU to get knowledge of the times or seasons which the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction;
Acts	44	1	8	but YOU will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon YOU, and YOU will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.”
Acts	44	1	9	And after he had said these things, while they were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their vision.
Acts	44	1	10	And as they were gazing into the sky while he was on his way, also, look! two men in white garments stood alongside them,
Acts	44	1	11	and they said: “Men of Galilee, why do YOU stand looking into the sky? This Jesus who was received up from YOU into the sky will come thus in the same manner as YOU have beheld him going into the sky.”
Acts	44	1	12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from a mountain called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, being a sabbath day’s journey away.
Acts	44	1	13	So, when they had entered, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying, Peter as well as John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the zealous one, and Judas the son of James.
Acts	44	1	14	With one accord all these were persisting in prayer, together with some women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.
Acts	44	1	15	Now during these days Peter rose up in the midst of the brothers and said (the crowd of persons was all together about one hundred and twenty):
Acts	44	1	16	“Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled, which the holy spirit spoke beforehand by David’s mouth about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,
Acts	44	1	17	because he had been numbered among us and he obtained a share in this ministry.
Acts	44	1	18	(This very man, therefore, purchased a field with the wages for unrighteousness, and pitching head foremost he noisily burst in his midst and all his intestines were poured out.
Acts	44	1	19	It also became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
Acts	44	1	20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his lodging place become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it,’ and, ‘His office of oversight let someone else take.’
Acts	44	1	21	It is therefore necessary that of the men that assembled with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
Acts	44	1	22	starting with his baptism by John and until the day he was received up from us, one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
Acts	44	1	23	So they put up two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Acts	44	1	24	And they prayed and said: “You, O Jehovah, who know the hearts of all, designate which one of these two men you have chosen,
Acts	44	1	25	to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas deviated to go to his own place.”
Acts	44	1	26	So they cast lots over them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was reckoned along with the eleven apostles.

Acts	44	2	1	Now while the day of the festival of Pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place,
Acts	44	2	2	and suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
Acts	44	2	3	And tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed about, and one sat upon each one of them,
Acts	44	2	4	and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance.
Acts	44	2	5	As it was, there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, reverent men, from every nation of those under heaven.
Acts	44	2	6	So, when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
Acts	44	2	7	Indeed, they were astonished and began to wonder and say: “See here, all these who are speaking are Galileans, are they not?
Acts	44	2	8	And yet how is it we are hearing, each one of us, his own language in which we were born?
Acts	44	2	9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the district of Asia,
Acts	44	2	10	and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya, which is toward Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts	44	2	11	Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues about the magnificent things of God.”
Acts	44	2	12	Yes, they were all astonished and were in perplexity, saying one to another: “What does this thing purport to be?”
Acts	44	2	13	However, different ones mocked at them and began to say: “They are full of sweet wine.”
Acts	44	2	14	But Peter stood up with the eleven and raised his voice and made this utterance to them: “Men of Judea and all YOU inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to YOU and give ear to my sayings.
Acts	44	2	15	These people are, in fact, not drunk, as YOU suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.
Acts	44	2	16	On the contrary, this is what was said through the prophet Joel,
Acts	44	2	17	‘“And in the last days,” God says, “I shall pour out some of my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and YOUR sons and YOUR daughters will prophesy and YOUR young men will see visions and YOUR old men will dream dreams;
Acts	44	2	18	and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
Acts	44	2	19	And I will give portents in heaven above and signs on earth below, blood and fire and smoke mist;
Acts	44	2	20	the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and illustrious day of Jehovah arrives.
Acts	44	2	21	And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”’
Acts	44	2	22	“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man publicly shown by God to YOU through powerful works and portents and signs that God did through him in YOUR midst, just as YOU yourselves know,
Acts	44	2	23	this man, as one delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, YOU fastened to a stake by the hand of lawless men and did away with.
Acts	44	2	24	But God resurrected him by loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to continue to be held fast by it.
Acts	44	2	25	For David says respecting him, ‘I had Jehovah constantly before my eyes; because he is at my right hand that I may never be shaken.
Acts	44	2	26	On this account my heart became cheerful and my tongue rejoiced greatly. Moreover, even my flesh will reside in hope;
Acts	44	2	27	because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your loyal one to see corruption.
Acts	44	2	28	You have made life’s ways known to me, you will fill me with good cheer with your face.’
Acts	44	2	29	“Men, brothers, it is allowable to speak with freeness of speech to YOU concerning the family head David, that he both deceased and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day.
Acts	44	2	30	Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one from the fruitage of his loins upon his throne,
Acts	44	2	31	he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Hades nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts	44	2	32	This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses.
Acts	44	2	33	Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which YOU see and hear.
Acts	44	2	34	Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand,
Acts	44	2	35	until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’
Acts	44	2	36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom YOU impaled.”
Acts	44	2	37	Now when they heard this they were stabbed to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Men, brothers, what shall we do?”
Acts	44	2	38	Peter said to them: “Repent, and let each one of YOU be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of YOUR sins, and YOU will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.
Acts	44	2	39	For the promise is to YOU and to YOUR children and to all those afar off, just as many as Jehovah our God may call to him.”
Acts	44	2	40	And with many other words he bore thorough witness and kept exhorting them, saying: “Get saved from this crooked generation.”
Acts	44	2	41	Therefore those who embraced his word heartily were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.
Acts	44	2	42	And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to sharing with one another, to taking of meals and to prayers.
Acts	44	2	43	Indeed, fear began to fall upon every soul, and many portents and signs began to occur through the apostles.
Acts	44	2	44	All those who became believers were together in having all things in common,
Acts	44	2	45	and they went selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all, just as anyone would have the need.
Acts	44	2	46	And day after day they were in constant attendance at the temple with one accord, and they took their meals in private homes and partook of food with great rejoicing and sincerity of heart,
Acts	44	2	47	praising God and finding favor with all the people. At the same time Jehovah continued to join to them daily those being saved.

Acts	44	3	1	Now Peter and John were going up into the temple for the hour of prayer, the ninth hour,
Acts	44	3	2	and a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, and they would daily put him near the temple door that was called Beautiful, in order to ask gifts of mercy from those entering into the temple.
Acts	44	3	3	When he caught sight of Peter and John about to go into the temple he began requesting to get gifts of mercy.
Acts	44	3	4	But Peter, together with John, gazed at him and said: “Take a look at us.”
Acts	44	3	5	So he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to get something from them.
Acts	44	3	6	However, Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have is what I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!”
Acts	44	3	7	With that he took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up. Instantly the soles of his feet and his anklebones were made firm;
Acts	44	3	8	and, leaping up, he stood up and began walking, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
Acts	44	3	9	And all the people got sight of him walking and praising God.
Acts	44	3	10	Moreover, they began to recognize him, that this was the man that used to sit for gifts of mercy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they became filled with astonishment and ecstasy at what had happened to him.
Acts	44	3	11	Well, as the man was holding onto Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at what was called Solomon’s colonnade, surprised out of their wits.
Acts	44	3	12	When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Men of Israel, why are YOU wondering over this, or why are YOU gazing at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk?
Acts	44	3	13	The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom YOU, for YOUR part, delivered up and disowned before Pilate’s face, when he had decided to release him.
Acts	44	3	14	Yes, YOU disowned that holy and righteous one, and YOU asked for a man, a murderer, to be freely granted to YOU,
Acts	44	3	15	whereas YOU killed the Chief Agent of life. But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses.
Acts	44	3	16	Consequently his name, by our faith in his name, has made this man strong whom YOU behold and know, and the faith that is through him has given the man this complete soundness in the sight of all of YOU.
Acts	44	3	17	And now, brothers, I know that YOU acted in ignorance, just as YOUR rulers also did.
Acts	44	3	18	But in this way God has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer.
Acts	44	3	19	“Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get YOUR sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah
Acts	44	3	20	and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for YOU, Jesus,
Acts	44	3	21	whom heaven, indeed, must hold within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time.
Acts	44	3	22	In fact, Moses said, ‘Jehovah God will raise up for YOU from among YOUR brothers a prophet like me. YOU must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to YOU.
Acts	44	3	23	Indeed, any soul that does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.’
Acts	44	3	24	And all the prophets, in fact, from Samuel on and those in succession, just as many as have spoken, have also plainly declared these days.
Acts	44	3	25	YOU are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God covenanted with YOUR forefathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth will be blessed.’
Acts	44	3	26	To YOU first God, after raising up his Servant, sent him forth to bless YOU by turning each one away from YOUR wicked deeds.”

Acts	44	4	1	Now while the two were speaking to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
Acts	44	4	2	being annoyed because they were teaching the people and were plainly declaring the resurrection from the dead in the case of Jesus;
Acts	44	4	3	and they laid their hands upon them and put them in custody till the next day, for it was already evening.
Acts	44	4	4	However, many of those who had listened to the speech believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.
Acts	44	4	5	The next day there took place in Jerusalem the gathering together of their rulers and older men and scribes
Acts	44	4	6	(also Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the chief priest’s kinsfolk),
Acts	44	4	7	and they stood them in their midst and began to inquire: “By what power or in whose name did YOU do this?”
Acts	44	4	8	Then Peter, filled with holy spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and older men,
Acts	44	4	9	if we are this day being examined, on the basis of a good deed to an ailing man, as to by whom this man has been made well,
Acts	44	4	10	let it be known to all of YOU and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom YOU impaled but whom God raised up from the dead, by this one does this man stand here sound in front of YOU.
Acts	44	4	11	This is ‘the stone that was treated by YOU builders as of no account that has become the head of the corner.’
Acts	44	4	12	Furthermore, there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”
Acts	44	4	13	Now when they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering. And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus;
Acts	44	4	14	and as they were looking at the man that had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in rebuttal.
Acts	44	4	15	So they commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin hall, and they began consulting with one another,
Acts	44	4	16	saying: “What shall we do with these men? Because, for a fact, a noteworthy sign has occurred through them, one manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
Acts	44	4	17	Nevertheless, in order that it may not be spread abroad further among the people, let us tell them with threats not to speak anymore upon the basis of this name to any man at all.”
Acts	44	4	18	With that they called them and charged them, nowhere to make any utterance or to teach upon the basis of the name of Jesus.
Acts	44	4	19	But in reply Peter and John said to them: “Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to YOU rather than to God, judge for yourselves.
Acts	44	4	20	But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.”
Acts	44	4	21	So, when they had further threatened them, they released them, since they did not find any ground on which to punish them and on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God over what had occurred;
Acts	44	4	22	for the man upon whom this sign of healing had occurred was more than forty years old.
Acts	44	4	23	After being released they went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them.
Acts	44	4	24	Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: “Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,
Acts	44	4	25	and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, ‘Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things?
Acts	44	4	26	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.’
Acts	44	4	27	Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
Acts	44	4	28	in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur.
Acts	44	4	29	And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness,
Acts	44	4	30	while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
Acts	44	4	31	And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.
Acts	44	4	32	Moreover, the multitude of those who had believed had one heart and soul, and not even one would say that any of the things he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.
Acts	44	4	33	Also, with great power the apostles continued giving forth the witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and undeserved kindness in large measure was upon them all.
Acts	44	4	34	In fact, there was not one in need among them; for all those who were possessors of fields or houses would sell them and bring the values of the things sold
Acts	44	4	35	and they would deposit them at the feet of the apostles. In turn distribution would be made to each one, just as he would have the need.
Acts	44	4	36	So Joseph, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, which means, when translated, Son of Comfort, a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
Acts	44	4	37	possessing a piece of land, sold it and brought the money and deposited it at the feet of the apostles.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	5	1	However, a certain man, Ananias by name, together with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession
Acts	44	5	2	and secretly held back some of the price, his wife also knowing about it, and he brought just a part and deposited it at the feet of the apostles.
Acts	44	5	3	But Peter said: “Ananias, why has Satan emboldened you to play false to the holy spirit and to hold back secretly some of the price of the field?
Acts	44	5	4	As long as it remained with you did it not remain yours, and after it was sold did it not continue in your control? Why was it that you purposed such a deed as this in your heart? You have played false, not to men, but to God.”
Acts	44	5	5	On hearing these words Ananias fell down and expired. And great fear came over all those hearing of it.
Acts	44	5	6	But the younger men rose, wrapped him in cloths, and carried him out and buried him.
Acts	44	5	7	Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
Acts	44	5	8	Peter said to her: “Tell me, did YOU two sell the field for so much?” She said: “Yes, for so much.”
Acts	44	5	9	So Peter said to her: “Why was it agreed upon between YOU two to make a test of the spirit of Jehovah? Look! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.”
Acts	44	5	10	Instantly she fell down at his feet and expired. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her alongside her husband.
Acts	44	5	11	Consequently great fear came over the whole congregation and over all those hearing about these things.
Acts	44	5	12	Moreover, through the hands of the apostles many signs and portents continued to occur among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s colonnade.
Acts	44	5	13	True, not a one of the others had the courage to join himself to them; nevertheless, the people were extolling them.
Acts	44	5	14	More than that, believers in the Lord kept on being added, multitudes both of men and of women;
Acts	44	5	15	so that they brought the sick out even into the broad ways and laid them there upon little beds and cots, in order that, as Peter would go by, at least his shadow might fall upon some one of them.
Acts	44	5	16	Also, the multitude from the cities around Jerusalem kept coming together, bearing sick people and those troubled with unclean spirits, and they would one and all be cured.
Acts	44	5	17	But the high priest and all those with him, the then existing sect of the Sadducees, rose and became filled with jealousy,
Acts	44	5	18	and they laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public place of custody.
Acts	44	5	19	But during the night Jehovah’s angel opened the doors of the prison, brought them out and said:
Acts	44	5	20	“Be on YOUR way, and, having taken a stand in the temple, keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.”
Acts	44	5	21	After hearing this, they entered into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin and all the assembly of older men of the sons of Israel, and they sent out to the jail to have them brought.
Acts	44	5	22	But when the officers got there they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and made report,
Acts	44	5	23	saying: “The jail we found locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but on opening up we found no one inside.”
Acts	44	5	24	Well, when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they fell into a quandary over these matters as to what this would come to.
Acts	44	5	25	But a certain man arrived and reported to them: “Look! The men YOU put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.”
Acts	44	5	26	Then the captain went off with his officers and proceeded to bring them, but without violence, as they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
Acts	44	5	27	So they brought them and stood them in the Sanhedrin hall. And the high priest questioned them
Acts	44	5	28	and said: “We positively ordered YOU not to keep teaching upon the basis of this name, and yet, look! YOU have filled Jerusalem with YOUR teaching, and YOU are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us.”
Acts	44	5	29	In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.
Acts	44	5	30	The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom YOU slew, hanging him upon a stake.
Acts	44	5	31	God exalted this one as Chief Agent and Savior to his right hand, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
Acts	44	5	32	And we are witnesses of these matters, and so is the holy spirit, which God has given to those obeying him as ruler.”
Acts	44	5	33	When they heard this, they felt deeply cut and were wanting to do away with them.
Acts	44	5	34	But a certain man rose in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a Law teacher esteemed by all the people, and gave the command to put the men outside for a little while.
Acts	44	5	35	And he said to them: “Men of Israel, pay attention to yourselves as to what YOU intend to do respecting these men.
Acts	44	5	36	For instance, before these days Theudas rose, saying he himself was somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined his party. But he was done away with, and all those who were obeying him were dispersed and came to nothing.
Acts	44	5	37	After him Judas the Galilean rose in the days of the registration, and he drew off people after him. And yet that man perished, and all those who were obeying him were scattered abroad.
Acts	44	5	38	And so, under the present circumstances, I say to YOU, Do not meddle with these men, but let them alone; (because, if this scheme or this work is from men, it will be overthrown;
Acts	44	5	39	but if it is from God, YOU will not be able to overthrow them;) otherwise, YOU may perhaps be found fighters actually against God.”
Acts	44	5	40	At this they gave heed to him, and they summoned the apostles, flogged them, and ordered them to stop speaking upon the basis of Jesus’ name, and let them go.
Acts	44	5	41	These, therefore, went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.
Acts	44	5	42	And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.

Acts	44	6	1	Now in these days, when the disciples were increasing, a murmuring arose on the part of the Greek-speaking Jews against the Hebrew-speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.
Acts	44	6	2	So the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said: “It is not pleasing for us to leave the word of God to distribute food to tables.
Acts	44	6	3	So, brothers, search out for yourselves seven certified men from among YOU, full of spirit and wisdom, that we may appoint them over this necessary business;
Acts	44	6	4	but we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
Acts	44	6	5	And the thing spoken was pleasing to the whole multitude, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and holy spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;
Acts	44	6	6	and they placed them before the apostles, and, after having prayed, these laid their hands upon them.
Acts	44	6	7	Consequently the word of God went on growing, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying in Jerusalem very much; and a great crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.
Acts	44	6	8	Now Stephen, full of graciousness and power, was performing great portents and signs among the people.
Acts	44	6	9	But certain men rose up of those from the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen, and of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia, to dispute with Stephen;
Acts	44	6	10	and yet they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.
Acts	44	6	11	Then they secretly induced men to say: “We have heard him speaking blasphemous sayings against Moses and God.”
Acts	44	6	12	And they stirred up the people and the older men and the scribes, and, coming upon him suddenly, they took him by force and led him to the Sanhedrin.
Acts	44	6	13	And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: “This man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the Law.
Acts	44	6	14	For instance, we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will throw down this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”
Acts	44	6	15	And as all those sitting in the Sanhedrin gazed at him, they saw that his face was as an angel’s face.

Acts	44	7	1	But the high priest said: “Are these things so?”
Acts	44	7	2	He said: “Men, brothers and fathers, hear. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he took up residence in Haran,
Acts	44	7	3	and he said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come on into the land I shall show you.’
Acts	44	7	4	Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and took up residence in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to change his residence to this land in which YOU now dwell.
Acts	44	7	5	And yet he did not give him any inheritable possession in it, no, not a footbreadth; but he promised to give it to him as a possession, and after him to his seed, while as yet he had no child.
Acts	44	7	6	Moreover, God spoke to this effect, that his seed would be alien residents in a foreign land and the people would enslave them and afflict them for four hundred years.
Acts	44	7	7	‘And that nation for which they will slave I shall judge,’ God said, ‘and after these things they will come out and will render sacred service to me in this place.’
Acts	44	7	8	“He also gave him a covenant of circumcision; and thus he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve family heads.
Acts	44	7	9	And the family heads became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,
Acts	44	7	10	and he delivered him out of all his tribulations and gave him graciousness and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him to govern Egypt and his whole house.
Acts	44	7	11	But a famine came upon the whole of Egypt and Canaan, even a great tribulation; and our forefathers were not finding any provisions.
Acts	44	7	12	But Jacob heard there were foodstuffs in Egypt and he sent our forefathers out the first time.
Acts	44	7	13	And during the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and the family stock of Joseph became manifest to Pharaoh.
Acts	44	7	14	So Joseph sent out and called Jacob his father and all his relatives from that place, to the number of seventy-five souls.
Acts	44	7	15	Jacob went down into Egypt. And he deceased; and so did our forefathers,
Acts	44	7	16	and they were transferred to Shechem and were laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a price with silver money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts	44	7	17	“Just as the time was approaching for fulfillment of the promise that God had openly declared to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Acts	44	7	18	until there rose a different king over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph.
Acts	44	7	19	This one used statecraft against our race and wrongfully forced the fathers to expose their infants, that they might not be preserved alive.
Acts	44	7	20	In that particular time Moses was born, and he was divinely beautiful. And he was nursed three months in his father’s home.
Acts	44	7	21	But when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh picked him up and brought him up as her own son.
Acts	44	7	22	Consequently Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. In fact, he was powerful in his words and deeds.
Acts	44	7	23	“Now when the time of his fortieth year was being fulfilled, it came into his heart to make an inspection of his brothers, the sons of Israel.
Acts	44	7	24	And when he caught sight of a certain one being unjustly treated, he defended him and executed vengeance for the one being abused by striking the Egyptian down.
Acts	44	7	25	He was supposing his brothers would grasp that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not grasp it.
Acts	44	7	26	And the next day he appeared to them as they were fighting, and he tried to bring them together again in peace, saying, ‘Men, YOU are brothers. Why do YOU treat each other unjustly?’
Acts	44	7	27	But the one that was treating his neighbor unjustly thrust him away, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us?
Acts	44	7	28	You do not want to do away with me in the same manner that you did away with the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’
Acts	44	7	29	At this speech Moses took to flight and became an alien resident in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
Acts	44	7	30	“And when forty years were fulfilled, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel in the fiery flame of a thornbush.
Acts	44	7	31	Now when Moses saw it he marveled at the sight. But as he was approaching to investigate, Jehovah’s voice came,
Acts	44	7	32	‘I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ Seized with trembling, Moses did not dare to investigate further.
Acts	44	7	33	Jehovah said to him, ‘Take the sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.
Acts	44	7	34	I have certainly seen the wrongful treatment of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you off to Egypt.’
Acts	44	7	35	This Moses, whom they disowned, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge?’ this man God sent off as both ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the thornbush.
Acts	44	7	36	This man led them out after doing portents and signs in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
Acts	44	7	37	“This is the Moses that said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up for YOU from among YOUR brothers a prophet like me.’
Acts	44	7	38	This is he that came to be among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our forefathers, and he received living sacred pronouncements to give YOU.
Acts	44	7	39	To him our forefathers refused to become obedient, but they thrust him aside and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,
Acts	44	7	40	saying to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us to go ahead of us. For this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’
Acts	44	7	41	So they made a calf in those days and brought up a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands.
Acts	44	7	42	So God turned and handed them over to render sacred service to the army of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the prophets, ‘It was not to me that YOU offered victims and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, was it, O house of Israel?
Acts	44	7	43	But it was the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan that YOU took up, the figures which YOU made to worship them. Consequently I will deport YOU beyond Babylon.’
Acts	44	7	44	“Our forefathers had the tent of the witness in the wilderness, just as he gave orders when speaking to Moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
Acts	44	7	45	And our forefathers who succeeded to it also brought it in with Joshua into the land possessed by the nations, whom God thrust out from before our forefathers. Here it remained until the days of David.
Acts	44	7	46	He found favor in the sight of God and asked for the privilege of providing a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts	44	7	47	However, Solomon built a house for him.
Acts	44	7	48	Nevertheless, the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; just as the prophet says,
Acts	44	7	49	‘The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What sort of house will YOU build for me? Jehovah says. Or what is the place for my resting?
Acts	44	7	50	My hand made all these things, did it not?’
Acts	44	7	51	“Obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, YOU are always resisting the holy spirit; as YOUR forefathers did, so YOU do.
Acts	44	7	52	Which one of the prophets did YOUR forefathers not persecute? Yes, they killed those who made announcement in advance concerning the coming of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers YOU have now become,
Acts	44	7	53	YOU who received the Law as transmitted by angels but have not kept it.”
Acts	44	7	54	Well, at hearing these things they felt cut to their hearts and began to gnash their teeth at him.
Acts	44	7	55	But he, being full of holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God’s glory and of Jesus standing at God’s right hand,
Acts	44	7	56	and he said: “Look! I behold the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand.”
Acts	44	7	57	At this they cried out at the top of the voice and put their hands over their ears and rushed upon him with one accord.
Acts	44	7	58	And after throwing him outside the city, they began casting stones at him. And the witnesses laid down their outer garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.
Acts	44	7	59	And they went on casting stones at Stephen as he made appeal and said: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
Acts	44	7	60	Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice: “Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.” And after saying this he fell asleep in death.

Acts	44	8	1	Saul, for his part, was approving of the murder of him. On that day great persecution arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
Acts	44	8	2	But reverent men carried Stephen to the burial, and they made a great lamentation over him.
Acts	44	8	3	Saul, though, began to deal outrageously with the congregation. Invading one house after another and, dragging out both men and women, he would turn them over to prison.
Acts	44	8	4	However, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word.
Acts	44	8	5	Philip, for one, went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to them.
Acts	44	8	6	With one accord the crowds were paying attention to the things said by Philip while they listened and looked at the signs he was performing.
Acts	44	8	7	For there were many that had unclean spirits, and these would cry out with a loud voice and come out. Moreover, many that were paralyzed and lame were cured.
Acts	44	8	8	So there came to be a great deal of joy in that city.
Acts	44	8	9	Now in the city there was a certain man named Simon, who, prior to this, had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Samaria, saying he himself was somebody great.
Acts	44	8	10	And all of them, from the least to the greatest, would pay attention to him and say: “This man is the Power of God, which can be called Great.”
Acts	44	8	11	So they would pay attention to him because of his having amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts.
Acts	44	8	12	But when they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they proceeded to be baptized, both men and women.
Acts	44	8	13	Simon himself also became a believer, and, after being baptized, he was in constant attendance upon Philip; and he was amazed at beholding signs and great powerful works taking place.
Acts	44	8	14	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they dispatched Peter and John to them;
Acts	44	8	15	and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit.
Acts	44	8	16	For it had not yet fallen upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts	44	8	17	Then they went laying their hands upon them, and they began to receive holy spirit.
Acts	44	8	18	Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the spirit was given, he offered them money,
Acts	44	8	19	saying: “Give me also this authority, that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive holy spirit.”
Acts	44	8	20	But Peter said to him: “May your silver perish with you, because you thought through money to get possession of the free gift of God.
Acts	44	8	21	You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not straight in the sight of God.
Acts	44	8	22	Repent, therefore, of this badness of yours, and supplicate Jehovah that, if possible, the device of your heart may be forgiven you;
Acts	44	8	23	for I see you are a poisonous gall and a bond of unrighteousness.”
Acts	44	8	24	In answer Simon said: “YOU men, make supplication for me to Jehovah that none of the things YOU have said may come upon me.”
Acts	44	8	25	Therefore, when they had given the witness thoroughly and had spoken the word of Jehovah, they turned back to Jerusalem, and they went declaring the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts	44	8	26	However, Jehovah’s angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Rise and go to the south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)
Acts	44	8	27	With that he rose and went, and, look! an Ethiopian eunuch, a man in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, and who was over all her treasure. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
Acts	44	8	28	but he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.
Acts	44	8	29	So the spirit said to Philip: “Approach and join yourself to this chariot.”
Acts	44	8	30	Philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you actually know what you are reading?”
Acts	44	8	31	He said: “Really, how could I ever do so, unless someone guided me?” And he entreated Philip to get on and sit down with him.
Acts	44	8	32	Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading aloud was this: “As a sheep he was brought to the slaughter, and as a lamb that is voiceless before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.
Acts	44	8	33	During his humiliation the judgment was taken away from him. Who will tell the details of his generation? Because his life is taken away from the earth.”
Acts	44	8	34	In answer the eunuch said to Philip: “I beg you, About whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about some other man?”
Acts	44	8	35	Philip opened his mouth and, starting with this Scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus.
Acts	44	8	36	Now as they were going over the road, they came to a certain body of water, and the eunuch said: “Look! A body of water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”
Acts	44	8	37	——
Acts	44	8	38	With that he commanded the chariot to halt, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
Acts	44	8	39	When they had come up out of the water, Jehovah’s spirit quickly led Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he kept going on his way rejoicing.
Acts	44	8	40	But Philip was found to be in Ashdod, and he went through the territory and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to Caesarea.

Acts	44	9	1	But Saul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
Acts	44	9	2	and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that he might bring bound to Jerusalem any whom he found who belonged to The Way, both men and women.
Acts	44	9	3	Now as he was traveling he approached Damascus, when suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him,
Acts	44	9	4	and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
Acts	44	9	5	He said: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
Acts	44	9	6	Nevertheless, rise and enter into the city, and what you must do will be told you.”
Acts	44	9	7	Now the men that were journeying with him were standing speechless, hearing, indeed, the sound of a voice, but not beholding any man.
Acts	44	9	8	But Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were opened he was seeing nothing. So they led him by the hand and conducted him into Damascus.
Acts	44	9	9	And for three days he did not see anything, and he neither ate nor drank.
Acts	44	9	10	There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “Ananias!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.”
Acts	44	9	11	The Lord said to him: “Rise, go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. For, look! he is praying,
Acts	44	9	12	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands upon him that he might recover sight.”
Acts	44	9	13	But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many injurious things he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.
Acts	44	9	14	And here he has authority from the chief priests to put in bonds all those calling upon your name.”
Acts	44	9	15	But the Lord said to him: “Be on your way, because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.
Acts	44	9	16	For I shall show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.”
Acts	44	9	17	So Ananias went off and entered into the house, and he laid his hands upon him and said: “Saul, brother, the Lord, the Jesus that appeared to you on the road over which you were coming, has sent me forth, in order that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit.”
Acts	44	9	18	And immediately there fell from his eyes what looked like scales, and he recovered sight; and he rose and was baptized,
Acts	44	9	19	and he took food and gained strength. He got to be for some days with the disciples in Damascus,
Acts	44	9	20	and immediately in the synagogues he began to preach Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.
Acts	44	9	21	But all those hearing him gave way to astonishment and would say: “Is this not the man that ravaged those in Jerusalem who call upon this name, and that had come here for this very purpose, that he might lead them bound to the chief priests?”
Acts	44	9	22	But Saul kept on acquiring power all the more and was confounding the Jews that dwelt in Damascus as he proved logically that this is the Christ.
Acts	44	9	23	Now when a good many days were coming to a close, the Jews took counsel together to do away with him.
Acts	44	9	24	However, their plot against him became known to Saul. But they were closely watching also the gates both day and night in order to do away with him.
Acts	44	9	25	So his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
Acts	44	9	26	On arriving in Jerusalem he made efforts to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a disciple.
Acts	44	9	27	So Barnabas came to his aid and led him to the apostles, and he told them in detail how on the road he had seen the Lord and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts	44	9	28	And he continued with them, walking in and out at Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord;
Acts	44	9	29	and he was talking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews. But these made attempts to do away with him.
Acts	44	9	30	When the brothers detected this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
Acts	44	9	31	Then, indeed, the congregation throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria entered into a period of peace, being built up; and as it walked in the fear of Jehovah and in the comfort of the holy spirit it kept on multiplying.
Acts	44	9	32	Now as Peter was going through all parts he came down also to the holy ones that dwelt in Lydda.
Acts	44	9	33	There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been lying flat on his cot for eight years, as he was paralyzed.
Acts	44	9	34	And Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and make up your bed.” And he rose immediately.
Acts	44	9	35	And all those who inhabited Lydda and the plain of Sharon saw him, and these turned to the Lord.
Acts	44	9	36	But in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which, when translated, means Dorcas. She abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy that she was rendering.
Acts	44	9	37	But in those days she happened to fall sick and die. So they bathed her and laid her in an upper chamber.
Acts	44	9	38	Now as Lydda was near Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in this city they dispatched two men to him to entreat him: “Please do not hesitate to come on as far as us.”
Acts	44	9	39	At that Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they led him up into the upper chamber; and all the widows presented themselves to him weeping and exhibiting many inner garments and outer garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.
Acts	44	9	40	But Peter put everybody outside and, bending his knees, he prayed, and, turning to the body, he said: “Tabitha, rise!” She opened her eyes and, as she caught sight of Peter, she sat up.
Acts	44	9	41	Giving her his hand, he raised her up, and he called the holy ones and the widows and presented her alive.
Acts	44	9	42	This became known throughout all Joppa, and many became believers on the Lord.
Acts	44	9	43	For quite a few days he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	10	1	Now in Caesarea there was a certain man named Cornelius, an army officer of the Italian band, as it was called,
Acts	44	10	2	a devout man and one fearing God together with all his household, and he made many gifts of mercy to the people and made supplication to God continually.
Acts	44	10	3	Just about the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God come in to him and say to him: “Cornelius!”
Acts	44	10	4	The man gazed at him and, becoming frightened, said: “What is it, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and gifts of mercy have ascended as a remembrance before God.
Acts	44	10	5	So now send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon who is surnamed Peter.
Acts	44	10	6	This man is being entertained by a certain Simon, a tanner, who has a house by the sea.”
Acts	44	10	7	As soon as the angel that spoke to him had left, he called two of his house servants and a devout soldier from among those who were in constant attendance upon him,
Acts	44	10	8	and he related everything to them and dispatched them to Joppa.
Acts	44	10	9	The next day as they were pursuing their journey and were approaching the city, Peter went up to the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
Acts	44	10	10	But he became very hungry and wanted to eat. While they were preparing, he fell into a trance
Acts	44	10	11	and beheld heaven opened and some sort of vessel descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four extremities upon the earth;
Acts	44	10	12	and in it there were all sorts of four-footed creatures and creeping things of the earth and birds of heaven.
Acts	44	10	13	And a voice came to him: “Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!”
Acts	44	10	14	But Peter said: “Not at all, Lord, because never have I eaten anything defiled and unclean.”
Acts	44	10	15	And the voice spoke again to him, the second time: “You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.”
Acts	44	10	16	This occurred a third time, and immediately the vessel was taken up into heaven.
Acts	44	10	17	Now while Peter was in great perplexity inwardly over what the vision he had seen might mean, look! the men dispatched by Cornelius had made inquiries for Simon’s house and stood there at the gate.
Acts	44	10	18	And they called out and inquired whether Simon who was surnamed Peter was being entertained there.
Acts	44	10	19	As Peter was going over in his mind about the vision, the spirit said: “Look! Three men are seeking you.
Acts	44	10	20	However, rise, go downstairs and be on your way with them, not doubting at all, because I have dispatched them.”
Acts	44	10	21	So Peter went downstairs to the men and said: “Look! I am the one YOU are seeking. What is the cause for which YOU are present?”
Acts	44	10	22	They said: “Cornelius, an army officer, a man righteous and fearing God and well reported by the whole nation of the Jews, was given divine instructions by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear the things you have to say.”
Acts	44	10	23	Therefore he invited them in and entertained them. The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brothers that were from Joppa went with him.
Acts	44	10	24	On the day after that he entered into Caesarea. Cornelius, of course, was expecting them and had called together his relatives and intimate friends.
Acts	44	10	25	As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet and did obeisance to him.
Acts	44	10	26	But Peter lifted him up, saying: “Rise; I myself am also a man.”
Acts	44	10	27	And as he conversed with him he went in and found many people assembled,
Acts	44	10	28	and he said to them: “YOU well know how unlawful it is for a Jew to join himself to or approach a man of another race; and yet God has shown me I should call no man defiled or unclean.
Acts	44	10	29	Hence I came, really without objection, when I was sent for. Therefore I inquire the reason that YOU have sent for me.”
Acts	44	10	30	Accordingly Cornelius said: “Four days ago counting from this hour I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, when, look! a man in bright raiment stood before me
Acts	44	10	31	and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.
Acts	44	10	32	Send, therefore, to Joppa and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter. This man is being entertained in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’
Acts	44	10	33	Therefore I at once sent to you, and you did well in coming here. And so at this time we are all present before God to hear all the things you have been commanded by Jehovah to say.”
Acts	44	10	34	At this Peter opened his mouth and said: “For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial,
Acts	44	10	35	but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.
Acts	44	10	36	He sent out the word to the sons of Israel to declare to them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ: this One is Lord of all others.
Acts	44	10	37	YOU know the subject that was talked about throughout the whole of Judea, starting from Galilee after the baptism that John preached,
Acts	44	10	38	namely, Jesus who was from Nazareth, how God anointed him with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil; because God was with him.
Acts	44	10	39	And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; but they also did away with him by hanging him on a stake.
Acts	44	10	40	God raised this One up on the third day and granted him to become manifest,
Acts	44	10	41	not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.
Acts	44	10	42	Also, he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the One decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
Acts	44	10	43	To him all the prophets bear witness, that everyone putting faith in him gets forgiveness of sins through his name.”
Acts	44	10	44	While Peter was yet speaking about these matters the holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.
Acts	44	10	45	And the faithful ones that had come with Peter who were of those circumcised were amazed, because the free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also upon people of the nations.
Acts	44	10	46	For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter responded:
Acts	44	10	47	“Can anyone forbid water so that these might not be baptized who have received the holy spirit even as we have?”
Acts	44	10	48	With that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested him to remain for some days.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	11	1	Now the apostles and the brothers that were in Judea heard that people of the nations had also received the word of God.
Acts	44	11	2	So when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the supporters of circumcision began to contend with him,
Acts	44	11	3	saying he had gone into the house of men that were not circumcised and had eaten with them.
Acts	44	11	4	At this Peter commenced and went on to explain the particulars to them, saying:
Acts	44	11	5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, some sort of vessel descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four extremities from heaven, and it came clear to me.
Acts	44	11	6	Gazing into it, I made observations and saw four-footed creatures of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of heaven.
Acts	44	11	7	I also heard a voice say to me, ‘Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!’
Acts	44	11	8	But I said, ‘Not at all, Lord, because a defiled or unclean thing has never entered into my mouth.’
Acts	44	11	9	The second time the voice from heaven answered, ‘You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.’
Acts	44	11	10	This occurred for a third time, and everything was pulled up again into heaven.
Acts	44	11	11	Also, look! at that instant there were three men standing at the house in which we were, they having been dispatched from Caesarea to me.
Acts	44	11	12	So the spirit told me to go with them, not doubting at all. But these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.
Acts	44	11	13	“He reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say, ‘Dispatch men to Joppa and send for Simon who is surnamed Peter,
Acts	44	11	14	and he will speak those things to you by which you and all your household may get saved.’
Acts	44	11	15	But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell upon them just as it did also upon us in the beginning.
Acts	44	11	16	At this I called to mind the saying of the Lord, how he used to say, ‘John, for his part, baptized with water, but YOU will be baptized in holy spirit.’
Acts	44	11	17	If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them as he also did to us who have believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?”
Acts	44	11	18	Now when they heard these things, they acquiesced, and they glorified God, saying: “Well, then, God has granted repentance for the purpose of life to people of the nations also.”
Acts	44	11	19	Consequently those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, but speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.
Acts	44	11	20	However, out of them there were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus.
Acts	44	11	21	Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah was with them, and a great number that became believers turned to the Lord.
Acts	44	11	22	The account about them got to the ears of the congregation that was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch.
Acts	44	11	23	When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with hearty purpose;
Acts	44	11	24	for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.
Acts	44	11	25	So he went off to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul
Acts	44	11	26	and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.
Acts	44	11	27	Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts	44	11	28	One of them named Agabus rose and proceeded to indicate through the spirit that a great famine was about to come upon the entire inhabited earth; which, for that matter, did take place in the time of Claudius.
Acts	44	11	29	So those of the disciples determined, each of them according as anyone could afford it, to send a relief ministration to the brothers dwelling in Judea;
Acts	44	11	30	and this they did, dispatching it to the older men by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

Acts	44	12	1	About that particular time Herod the king applied his hands to mistreating some of those of the congregation.
Acts	44	12	2	He did away with James the brother of John by the sword.
Acts	44	12	3	As he saw it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter also. (As it was, those were days of the unfermented cakes.)
Acts	44	12	4	And laying hold of him, he put him in prison, turning him over to four shifts of four soldiers each to guard him, as he intended to produce him for the people after the passover.
Acts	44	12	5	Consequently Peter was being kept in the prison; but prayer to God for him was being carried on intensely by the congregation.
Acts	44	12	6	Now when Herod was about to produce him, that night Peter was sleeping bound with two chains between two soldiers, and guards before the door were keeping the prison.
Acts	44	12	7	But, look! Jehovah’s angel stood by, and a light shone in the prison cell. Striking Peter on the side, he roused him, saying: “Rise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands.
Acts	44	12	8	The angel said to him: “Gird yourself and bind your sandals on.” He did so. Finally he said to him: “Put your outer garment on and keep following me.”
Acts	44	12	9	And he went out and kept following him, but he did not know that what was happening through the angel was real. In fact, he supposed he was seeing a vision.
Acts	44	12	10	Going through the first sentinel guard and the second they got to the iron gate leading into the city, and this opened to them of its own accord. And after they went out they advanced down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
Acts	44	12	11	And Peter, coming to himself, said: “Now I actually know that Jehovah sent his angel forth and delivered me out of Herod’s hand and from all that the people of the Jews were expecting.”
Acts	44	12	12	And after he considered it, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who was surnamed Mark, where quite a few were gathered together and praying.
Acts	44	12	13	When he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to attend to the call,
Acts	44	12	14	and, upon recognizing the voice of Peter, out of joy she did not open the gate, but ran inside and reported that Peter was standing before the gateway.
Acts	44	12	15	They said to her: “You are mad.” But she kept on strongly asserting it was so. They began to say: “It is his angel.”
Acts	44	12	16	But Peter remained there knocking. When they opened, they saw him and were astonished.
Acts	44	12	17	But he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and told them in detail how Jehovah brought him out of the prison, and he said: “Report these things to James and the brothers.” With that he went out and journeyed to another place.
Acts	44	12	18	Well, when it became day, there was no little stir among the soldiers over what really had become of Peter.
Acts	44	12	19	Herod made diligent search for him and, when not finding him, he examined the guards and commanded them to be led off to punishment; and he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent some time there.
Acts	44	12	20	Now he was in a fighting mood against the people of Tyre and of Sidon. So with one accord they came to him and, after persuading Blastus, who was in charge of the bedchamber of the king, they began suing for peace, because their country was supplied with food from that of the king.
Acts	44	12	21	But on a set day Herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down upon the judgment seat and began giving them a public address.
Acts	44	12	22	In turn the assembled people began shouting: “A god’s voice, and not a man’s!”
Acts	44	12	23	Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God; and he became eaten up with worms and expired.
Acts	44	12	24	But the word of Jehovah went on growing and spreading.
Acts	44	12	25	As for Barnabas and Saul, after having fully carried out the relief ministration in Jerusalem, they returned and took along with them John, the one surnamed Mark.

Acts	44	13	1	Now in Antioch there were prophets and teachers in the local congregation, Barnabas as well as Symeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who was educated with Herod the district ruler, and Saul.
Acts	44	13	2	As they were publicly ministering to Jehovah and fasting, the holy spirit said: “Of all persons set Barnabas and Saul apart for me for the work to which I have called them.”
Acts	44	13	3	Then they fasted and prayed and laid their hands upon them and let them go.
Acts	44	13	4	Accordingly these men, sent out by the holy spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts	44	13	5	And when they got to be in Salamis they began publishing the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John also as an attendant.
Acts	44	13	6	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they met up with a certain man, a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,
Acts	44	13	7	and he was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. Calling Barnabas and Saul to him, this man earnestly sought to hear the word of God.
Acts	44	13	8	But Elymas the sorcerer (that, in fact, is the way his name is translated) began opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
Acts	44	13	9	Saul, who is also Paul, becoming filled with holy spirit, looked at him intently
Acts	44	13	10	and said: “O man full of every sort of fraud and every sort of villainy, you son of the Devil, you enemy of everything righteous, will you not quit distorting the right ways of Jehovah?
Acts	44	13	11	Well, then, look! Jehovah’s hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a period of time.” Instantly a thick mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went around seeking men to lead him by the hand.
Acts	44	13	12	Then the proconsul, upon seeing what had happened, became a believer, as he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah.
Acts	44	13	13	The men, together with Paul, now put out to sea from Paphos and arrived at Perga in Pamphylia. But John withdrew from them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts	44	13	14	They, however, went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia and, going into the synagogue on the sabbath day, they took a seat.
Acts	44	13	15	After the public reading of the Law and of the Prophets the presiding officers of the synagogue sent out to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if there is any word of encouragement for the people that YOU have, tell it.”
Acts	44	13	16	So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand, he said: “Men, Israelites and YOU others that fear God, hear.
Acts	44	13	17	The God of this people Israel chose our forefathers, and he exalted the people during their alien residence in the land of Egypt and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm.
Acts	44	13	18	And for a period of about forty years he put up with their manner of action in the wilderness.
Acts	44	13	19	After destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed the land of them by lot:
Acts	44	13	20	all that during about four hundred and fifty years. “And after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts	44	13	21	But from then on they demanded a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
Acts	44	13	22	And after removing him, he raised up for them David as king, respecting whom he bore witness and said, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man agreeable to my heart, who will do all the things I desire.’
Acts	44	13	23	From the offspring of this man according to his promise God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus,
Acts	44	13	24	after John, in advance of the entry of that One, had preached publicly to all the people of Israel baptism in symbol of repentance.
Acts	44	13	25	But as John was fulfilling his course, he would say, ‘What do YOU suppose I am? I am not he. But, look! one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’
Acts	44	13	26	“Men, brothers, YOU sons of the stock of Abraham and those others among YOU who fear God, the word of this salvation has been sent forth to us.
Acts	44	13	27	For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers did not know this One, but, when acting as judges, they fulfilled the things voiced by the Prophets, which things are read aloud every Sabbath,
Acts	44	13	28	and, although they found no cause for death, they demanded of Pilate that he be executed.
Acts	44	13	29	When, now, they had accomplished all the things written about him, they took him down from the stake and laid him in a memorial tomb.
Acts	44	13	30	But God raised him up from the dead;
Acts	44	13	31	and for many days he became visible to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
Acts	44	13	32	“And so we are declaring to YOU the good news about the promise made to the forefathers,
Acts	44	13	33	that God has entirely fulfilled it to us their children in that he resurrected Jesus; even as it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my son, I have become your Father this day.’
Acts	44	13	34	And that fact that he resurrected him from the dead destined no more to return to corruption, he has stated in this way, ‘I will give YOU people the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.’
Acts	44	13	35	Hence he also says in another psalm, ‘You will not allow your loyal one to see corruption.’
Acts	44	13	36	For David, on the one hand, served the express will of God in his own generation and fell asleep in death and was laid with his forefathers and did see corruption.
Acts	44	13	37	On the other hand, he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
Acts	44	13	38	“Let it therefore be known to YOU, brothers, that through this One a forgiveness of sins is being published to YOU;
Acts	44	13	39	and that from all the things from which YOU could not be declared guiltless by means of the law of Moses, everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this One.
Acts	44	13	40	Therefore see to it that what is said in the Prophets does not come upon YOU,
Acts	44	13	41	‘Behold it, YOU scorners, and wonder at it, and vanish away, because I am working a work in YOUR days, a work that YOU will by no means believe even if anyone relates it to YOU in detail.’”
Acts	44	13	42	Now when they were going out, the people began entreating for these matters to be spoken to them on the following sabbath.
Acts	44	13	43	So after the synagogue assembly was dissolved, many of the Jews and of the proselytes who worshiped God followed Paul and Barnabas, who in speaking to them began urging them to continue in the undeserved kindness of God.
Acts	44	13	44	The next sabbath nearly all the city gathered together to hear the word of Jehovah.
Acts	44	13	45	When the Jews got sight of the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things being spoken by Paul.
Acts	44	13	46	And so, talking with boldness, Paul and Barnabas said: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to YOU. Since YOU are thrusting it away from YOU and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations.
Acts	44	13	47	In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the extremity of the earth.’”
Acts	44	13	48	When those of the nations heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah, and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.
Acts	44	13	49	Furthermore, the word of Jehovah went on being carried throughout the whole country.
Acts	44	13	50	But the Jews stirred up the reputable women who worshiped God and the principal men of the city, and they raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them outside their boundaries.
Acts	44	13	51	These shook the dust off their feet against them and went to Iconium.
Acts	44	13	52	And the disciples continued to be filled with joy and holy spirit.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	14	1	Now in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks became believers.
Acts	44	14	2	But the Jews that did not believe stirred up and wrongly influenced the souls of people of the nations against the brothers.
Acts	44	14	3	Therefore they spent considerable time speaking with boldness by the authority of Jehovah, who bore witness to the word of his undeserved kindness by granting signs and portents to occur through their hands.
Acts	44	14	4	However, the multitude of the city was split, and some were for the Jews but others for the apostles.
Acts	44	14	5	Now when a violent attempt took place on the part of both people of the nations and Jews with their rulers, to treat them insolently and pelt them with stones,
Acts	44	14	6	they, on being informed of it, fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe and the country round about;
Acts	44	14	7	and there they went on declaring the good news.
Acts	44	14	8	Now in Lystra there was sitting a certain man disabled in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, and he had never walked at all.
Acts	44	14	9	This man was listening to Paul speak, who, on looking at him intently and seeing he had faith to be made well,
Acts	44	14	10	said with a loud voice: “Stand up erect on your feet.” And he leaped up and began walking.
Acts	44	14	11	And the crowds, seeing what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian tongue: “The gods have become like humans and have come down to us!”
Acts	44	14	12	And they went calling Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was the one taking the lead in speaking.
Acts	44	14	13	And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates and was desiring to offer sacrifices with the crowds.
Acts	44	14	14	However, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their outer garments and leaped out into the crowd, crying out
Acts	44	14	15	and saying: “Men, why are YOU doing these things? We also are humans having the same infirmities as YOU do, and are declaring the good news to YOU, for YOU to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them.
Acts	44	14	16	In the past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways,
Acts	44	14	17	although, indeed, he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving YOU rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling YOUR hearts to the full with food and good cheer.”
Acts	44	14	18	And yet by saying these things they scarcely restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.
Acts	44	14	19	But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining he was dead.
Acts	44	14	20	However, when the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
Acts	44	14	21	And after declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
Acts	44	14	22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith and saying: “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.”
Acts	44	14	23	Moreover, they appointed older men for them in each congregation and, offering prayer with fastings, they committed them to Jehovah in whom they had become believers.
Acts	44	14	24	And they went through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia,
Acts	44	14	25	and, after speaking the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
Acts	44	14	26	And from there they sailed off for Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of God for the work they had fully performed.
Acts	44	14	27	When they had arrived and had gathered the congregation together, they proceeded to relate the many things God had done by means of them, and that he had opened to the nations the door to faith.
Acts	44	14	28	So they spent not a little time with the disciples.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	15	1	And certain men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers: “Unless YOU get circumcised according to the custom of Moses, YOU cannot be saved.”
Acts	44	15	2	But when there had occurred no little dissension and disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up to the apostles and older men in Jerusalem regarding this dispute.
Acts	44	15	3	Accordingly, after being conducted partway by the congregation, these men continued on their way through both Phoenicia and Samaria, relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations, and they were causing great joy to all the brothers.
Acts	44	15	4	On arriving in Jerusalem they were kindly received by the congregation and the apostles and the older men, and they recounted the many things God had done by means of them.
Acts	44	15	5	Yet, some of those of the sect of the Pharisees that had believed rose up from their seats and said: “It is necessary to circumcise them and charge them to observe the law of Moses.”
Acts	44	15	6	And the apostles and the older men gathered together to see about this affair.
Acts	44	15	7	Now when much disputing had taken place, Peter rose and said to them: “Men, brothers, YOU well know that from early days God made the choice among YOU that through my mouth people of the nations should hear the word of the good news and believe;
Acts	44	15	8	and God, who knows the heart, bore witness by giving them the holy spirit, just as he did to us also.
Acts	44	15	9	And he made no distinction at all between us and them, but purified their hearts by faith.
Acts	44	15	10	Now, therefore, why are YOU making a test of God by imposing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we were capable of bearing?
Acts	44	15	11	On the contrary, we trust to get saved through the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus in the same way as those people also.”
Acts	44	15	12	At that the entire multitude became silent, and they began to listen to Barnabas and Paul relate the many signs and portents that God did through them among the nations.
Acts	44	15	13	After they quit speaking, James answered, saying: “Men, brothers, hear me.
Acts	44	15	14	Symeon has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.
Acts	44	15	15	And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,
Acts	44	15	16	‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again,
Acts	44	15	17	in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah, who is doing these things,
Acts	44	15	18	known from of old.’
Acts	44	15	19	Hence my decision is not to trouble those from the nations who are turning to God,
Acts	44	15	20	but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.
Acts	44	15	21	For from ancient times Moses has had in city after city those who preach him, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath.”
Acts	44	15	22	Then the apostles and the older men together with the whole congregation favored sending chosen men from among them to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, leading men among the brothers;
Acts	44	15	23	and by their hand they wrote: “The apostles and the older men, brothers, to those brothers in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the nations: Greetings!
Acts	44	15	24	Since we have heard that some from among us have caused YOU trouble with speeches, trying to subvert YOUR souls, although we did not give them any instructions,
Acts	44	15	25	we have come to a unanimous accord and have favored choosing men to send to YOU together with our loved ones, Barnabas and Paul,
Acts	44	15	26	men that have delivered up their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts	44	15	27	We are therefore dispatching Judas and Silas, that they also may report the same things by word.
Acts	44	15	28	For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to YOU, except these necessary things,
Acts	44	15	29	to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If YOU carefully keep yourselves from these things, YOU will prosper. Good health to YOU!”
Acts	44	15	30	Accordingly, when these men were let go, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the multitude together and handed them the letter.
Acts	44	15	31	After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
Acts	44	15	32	And Judas and Silas, since they themselves were also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them.
Acts	44	15	33	So, when they had passed some time, they were let go in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them out.
Acts	44	15	34	——
Acts	44	15	35	However, Paul and Barnabas continued spending time in Antioch teaching and declaring, with many others also, the good news of the word of Jehovah.
Acts	44	15	36	Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas: “Above all things, let us return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities in which we published the word of Jehovah to see how they are.”
Acts	44	15	37	For his part, Barnabas was determined to take along also John, who was called Mark.
Acts	44	15	38	But Paul did not think it proper to be taking this one along with them, seeing that he had departed from them from Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts	44	15	39	At this there occurred a sharp burst of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts	44	15	40	Paul selected Silas and went off after he had been entrusted by the brothers to the undeserved kindness of Jehovah.
Acts	44	15	41	But he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	16	1	So he arrived at Derbe and also at Lystra. And, look! a certain disciple was there by the name of Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father,
Acts	44	16	2	and he was well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
Acts	44	16	3	Paul expressed the desire for this man to go out with him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for one and all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts	44	16	4	Now as they traveled on through the cities they would deliver to those there for observance the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and older men who were in Jerusalem.
Acts	44	16	5	Therefore, indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.
Acts	44	16	6	Moreover, they went through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the district of Asia.
Acts	44	16	7	Further, when getting down to Mysia they made efforts to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
Acts	44	16	8	So they passed Mysia by and came down to Troas.
Acts	44	16	9	And during the night a vision appeared to Paul: a certain Macedonian man was standing and entreating him and saying: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.”
Acts	44	16	10	Now as soon as he had seen the vision, we sought to go forth into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.
Acts	44	16	11	Therefore we put out to sea from Troas and came with a straight run to Samothrace, but on the following day to Neapolis,
Acts	44	16	12	and from there to Philippi, a colony, which is the principal city of the district of Macedonia. We continued in this city, spending some days.
Acts	44	16	13	And on the sabbath day we went forth outside the gate beside a river, where we were thinking there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women that had assembled.
Acts	44	16	14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira and a worshiper of God, was listening, and Jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.
Acts	44	16	15	Now when she and her household got baptized, she said with entreaty: “If YOU men have judged me to be faithful to Jehovah, enter into my house and stay.” And she just made us come.
Acts	44	16	16	And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain servant girl with a spirit, a demon of divination, met us. She used to furnish her masters with much gain by practicing the art of prediction.
Acts	44	16	17	This girl kept following Paul and us and crying out with the words: “These men are slaves of the Most High God, who are publishing to YOU the way of salvation.”
Acts	44	16	18	This she kept doing for many days. Finally Paul got tired of it and turned and said to the spirit: “I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.
Acts	44	16	19	Well, when her masters saw that their hope of gain had left, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers,
Acts	44	16	20	and, leading them up to the civil magistrates, they said: “These men are disturbing our city very much, they being Jews,
Acts	44	16	21	and they are publishing customs that it is not lawful for us to take up or practice, seeing we are Romans.”
Acts	44	16	22	And the crowd rose up together against them; and the civil magistrates, after tearing the outer garments off them, gave the command to beat them with rods.
Acts	44	16	23	After they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.
Acts	44	16	24	Because he got such an order, he threw them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Acts	44	16	25	But about the middle of the night Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song; yes, the prisoners were hearing them.
Acts	44	16	26	Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the jail were shaken. Moreover, all the doors were instantly opened, and the bonds of all were loosened.
Acts	44	16	27	The jailer, being awakened out of sleep and seeing the prison doors were open, drew his sword and was about to do away with himself, imagining that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts	44	16	28	But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying: “Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!”
Acts	44	16	29	So he asked for lights and leaped in and, seized with trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas.
Acts	44	16	30	And he brought them outside and said: “Sirs, what must I do to get saved?”
Acts	44	16	31	They said: “Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will get saved, you and your household.”
Acts	44	16	32	And they spoke the word of Jehovah to him together with all those in his house.
Acts	44	16	33	And he took them along in that hour of the night and bathed their stripes; and, one and all, he and his were baptized without delay.
Acts	44	16	34	And he brought them into his house and set a table before them, and he rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed God.
Acts	44	16	35	When it became day, the civil magistrates dispatched the constables to say: “Release those men.”
Acts	44	16	36	So the jailer reported their words to Paul: “The civil magistrates have dispatched men that YOU two might be released. Now, therefore, come out and go YOUR way in peace.”
Acts	44	16	37	But Paul said to them: “They flogged us publicly uncondemned, men who are Romans, and threw us into prison; and are they now throwing us out secretly? No, indeed! but let them come themselves and bring us out.”
Acts	44	16	38	So the constables reported these sayings to the civil magistrates. These grew fearful when they heard that the men were Romans.
Acts	44	16	39	Consequently they came and entreated them and, after bringing them out, they requested them to depart from the city.
Acts	44	16	40	But they came out of the prison and went to the home of Lydia, and when they saw the brothers they encouraged them and departed.

Acts	44	17	1	They now journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts	44	17	2	So according to Paul’s custom he went inside to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts	44	17	3	explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying: “This is the Christ, this Jesus whom I am publishing to YOU.”
Acts	44	17	4	As a result some of them became believers and associated themselves with Paul and Silas, and a great multitude of the Greeks who worshiped God and not a few of the principal women did so.
Acts	44	17	5	But the Jews, getting jealous, took into their company certain wicked men of the marketplace idlers and formed a mob and proceeded to throw the city into an uproar. And they assaulted the house of Jason and went seeking to have them brought forth to the rabble.
Acts	44	17	6	When they did not find them they dragged Jason and certain brothers to the city rulers, crying out: “These men that have overturned the inhabited earth are present here also,
Acts	44	17	7	and Jason has received them with hospitality. And all these men act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.”
Acts	44	17	8	They indeed agitated the crowd and the city rulers when they heard these things;
Acts	44	17	9	and first after taking sufficient security from Jason and the others they let them go.
Acts	44	17	10	Immediately by night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas out to Beroea, and these, upon arriving, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts	44	17	11	Now the latter were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.
Acts	44	17	12	Therefore many of them became believers, and so did not a few of the reputable Greek women and of the men.
Acts	44	17	13	But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was published also in Beroea by Paul, they came there also to incite and agitate the masses.
Acts	44	17	14	Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off to go as far as the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained behind there.
Acts	44	17	15	However, those conducting Paul brought him as far as Athens and, after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.
Acts	44	17	16	Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit within him came to be irritated at beholding that the city was full of idols.
Acts	44	17	17	Consequently he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshiped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.
Acts	44	17	18	But certain ones of both the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers took to conversing with him controversially, and some would say: “What is it this chatterer would like to tell?” Others: “He seems to be a publisher of foreign deities.” This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts	44	17	19	So they laid hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying: “Can we get to know what this new teaching is which is spoken by you?
Acts	44	17	20	For you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears. Therefore we desire to get to know what these things purport to be.”
Acts	44	17	21	In fact, all Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there would spend their leisure time at nothing but telling something or listening to something new.
Acts	44	17	22	Paul now stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said: “Men of Athens, I behold that in all things YOU seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are.
Acts	44	17	23	For instance, while passing along and carefully observing YOUR objects of veneration I also found an altar on which had been inscribed ‘To an Unknown God.’ Therefore what YOU are unknowingly giving godly devotion to, this I am publishing to YOU.
Acts	44	17	24	The God that made the world and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples,
Acts	44	17	25	neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things.
Acts	44	17	26	And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of the dwelling of men,
Acts	44	17	27	for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.
Acts	44	17	28	For by him we have life and move and exist, even as certain ones of the poets among YOU have said, ‘For we are also his progeny.’
Acts	44	17	29	“Seeing, therefore, that we are the progeny of God, we ought not to imagine that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, like something sculptured by the art and contrivance of man.
Acts	44	17	30	True, God has overlooked the times of such ignorance, yet now he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent.
Acts	44	17	31	Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.”
Acts	44	17	32	Well, when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to mock, while others said: “We will hear you about this even another time.”
Acts	44	17	33	Thus Paul went out from their midst,
Acts	44	17	34	but some men joined themselves to him and became believers, among whom also were Dionysius, a judge of the court of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and others besides them.

Acts	44	18	1	After these things he departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
Acts	44	18	2	And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus who had recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, because of the fact that Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome. So he went to them
Acts	44	18	3	and on account of being of the same trade he stayed at their home, and they worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
Acts	44	18	4	However, he would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks.
Acts	44	18	5	When, now, both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ.
Acts	44	18	6	But after they kept on opposing and speaking abusively, he shook out his garments and said to them: “Let YOUR blood be upon YOUR own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to people of the nations.”
Acts	44	18	7	Accordingly he transferred from there and went into the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.
Acts	44	18	8	But Crispus the presiding officer of the synagogue became a believer in the Lord, and so did all his household. And many of the Corinthians that heard began to believe and be baptized.
Acts	44	18	9	Moreover, by night the Lord said to Paul through a vision: “Have no fear, but keep on speaking and do not keep silent,
Acts	44	18	10	because I am with you and no man will assault you so as to do you injury; for I have many people in this city.”
Acts	44	18	11	So he stayed set there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
Acts	44	18	12	Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul and led him to the judgment seat,
Acts	44	18	13	saying: “Contrary to the law this person leads men to another persuasion in worshiping God.”
Acts	44	18	14	But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If it were, indeed, some wrong or a wicked act of villainy, O Jews, I would with reason put up patiently with YOU.
Acts	44	18	15	But if it is controversies over speech and names and the law among YOU, YOU yourselves must see to it. I do not wish to be a judge of these things.”
Acts	44	18	16	With that he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Acts	44	18	17	So they all laid hold of Sosthenes the presiding officer of the synagogue and went to beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio would not concern himself at all with these things.
Acts	44	18	18	However, after staying quite some days longer, Paul said good-bye to the brothers and proceeded to sail away for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, as he had the hair of his head clipped short in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
Acts	44	18	19	So they arrived at Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts	44	18	20	Although they kept requesting him to remain for a longer time, he would not consent
Acts	44	18	21	but said good-bye and told them: “I will return to YOU again, if Jehovah is willing.” And he put out to sea from Ephesus
Acts	44	18	22	and came down to Caesarea. And he went up and greeted the congregation, and went down to Antioch.
Acts	44	18	23	And when he had passed some time there he departed and went from place to place through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
Acts	44	18	24	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, arrived in Ephesus; and he was well versed in the Scriptures.
Acts	44	18	25	This man had been orally instructed in the way of Jehovah and, as he was aglow with the spirit, he went speaking and teaching with correctness the things about Jesus, but being acquainted with only the baptism of John.
Acts	44	18	26	And this man started to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him into their company and expounded the way of God more correctly to him.
Acts	44	18	27	Further, because he was desiring to go across into Achaia, the brothers wrote the disciples, exhorting them to receive him kindly. So when he got there, he greatly helped those who had believed on account of God’s undeserved kindness;
Acts	44	18	28	for with intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong publicly, while he demonstrated by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	19	1	In the course of events, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland parts and came down to Ephesus, and found some disciples;
Acts	44	19	2	and he said to them: “Did you receive holy spirit when YOU became believers?” They said to him: “Why, we have never heard whether there is a holy spirit.”
Acts	44	19	3	And he said: “In what, then, were YOU baptized?” They said: “In John’s baptism.”
Acts	44	19	4	Paul said: “John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”
Acts	44	19	5	On hearing this, they got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts	44	19	6	And when Paul laid his hands upon them, the holy spirit came upon them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.
Acts	44	19	7	All together, there were about twelve men.
Acts	44	19	8	Entering into the synagogue, he spoke with boldness for three months, giving talks and using persuasion concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts	44	19	9	But when some went on hardening themselves and not believing, speaking injuriously about The Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them, daily giving talks in the school auditorium of Tyrannus.
Acts	44	19	10	This took place for two years, so that all those inhabiting the district of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts	44	19	11	And God kept performing extraordinary works of power through the hands of Paul,
Acts	44	19	12	so that even cloths and aprons were borne from his body to the ailing people, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits came out.
Acts	44	19	13	But certain ones of the roving Jews who practiced the casting out of demons also undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having the wicked spirits, saying: “I solemnly charge YOU by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”
Acts	44	19	14	Now there were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.
Acts	44	19	15	But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: “I know Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul; but who are YOU?”
Acts	44	19	16	With that the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, got the mastery of one after the other, and prevailed against them, so that they fled naked and wounded out of that house.
Acts	44	19	17	This became known to all, both the Jews and the Greeks that dwelt in Ephesus; and a fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus went on being magnified.
Acts	44	19	18	And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly.
Acts	44	19	19	Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. And they calculated together the prices of them and found them worth fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts	44	19	20	Thus in a mighty way the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.
Acts	44	19	21	Now when these things had been completed, Paul purposed in his spirit that, after going through Macedonia and Achaia, he would journey to Jerusalem, saying: “After I get there I must also see Rome.”
Acts	44	19	22	So he dispatched to Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself delayed for some time in the district of Asia.
Acts	44	19	23	At that particular time there arose no little disturbance concerning The Way.
Acts	44	19	24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines of Artemis furnished the craftsmen no little gain;
Acts	44	19	25	and he gathered them and those who worked at such things and said: “Men, YOU well know that from this business we have our prosperity.
Acts	44	19	26	Also, YOU behold and hear how not only in Ephesus but in nearly all the district of Asia this Paul has persuaded a considerable crowd and turned them to another opinion, saying that the ones that are made by hands are not gods.
Acts	44	19	27	Moreover, the danger exists not only that this occupation of ours will come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be esteemed as nothing and even her magnificence which the whole district of Asia and the inhabited earth worships is about to be brought down to nothing.”
Acts	44	19	28	Hearing this and becoming full of anger, the men began crying out, saying: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
Acts	44	19	29	So the city became filled with confusion, and with one accord they rushed into the theater, taking forcibly along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.
Acts	44	19	30	For his part, Paul was willing to go inside to the people, but the disciples would not permit him.
Acts	44	19	31	Even some of the commissioners of festivals and games, who were friendly to him, sent to him and began pleading for him not to risk himself in the theater.
Acts	44	19	32	The fact is, some were crying out one thing and others another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority of them did not know the reason why they had come together.
Acts	44	19	33	So together they brought Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him up front; and Alexander motioned with his hand and was wanting to make his defense to the people.
Acts	44	19	34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, one cry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
Acts	44	19	35	When, finally, the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said: “Men of Ephesus, who really is there of mankind that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven?
Acts	44	19	36	Therefore since these things are indisputable, it is becoming for YOU to keep calm and not act rashly.
Acts	44	19	37	For YOU have brought these men who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts	44	19	38	Therefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him do have a case against someone, court days are held and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.
Acts	44	19	39	If, though, YOU are searching for anything beyond that, it must be decided in a regular assembly.
Acts	44	19	40	For we are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, no single cause existing that will permit us to render a reason for this disorderly mob.”
Acts	44	19	41	And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	20	1	Now after the uproar had subsided, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had encouraged them and bidden them farewell, he went forth to journey into Macedonia.
Acts	44	20	2	After going through those parts and encouraging the ones there with many a word, he came into Greece.
Acts	44	20	3	And when he had spent three months there, because a plot was hatched against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he made up his mind to return through Macedonia.
Acts	44	20	4	There were accompanying him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and from the district of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts	44	20	5	These went on and were waiting for us in Troas;
Acts	44	20	6	but we put out to sea from Philippi after the days of the unfermented cakes, and we came to them in Troas within five days; and there we spent seven days.
Acts	44	20	7	On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to have a meal, Paul began discoursing to them, as he was going to depart the next day; and he prolonged his speech until midnight.
Acts	44	20	8	So there were quite a few lamps in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
Acts	44	20	9	Seated at the window, a certain young man named Eutychus fell into a deep sleep while Paul kept talking on, and, collapsing in sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
Acts	44	20	10	But Paul went downstairs, threw himself upon him and embraced him and said: “STOP raising a clamor, for his soul is in him.”
Acts	44	20	11	He now went upstairs and began the meal and took food, and after conversing for quite a while, until daybreak, he at length departed.
Acts	44	20	12	So they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure.
Acts	44	20	13	We now went ahead to the boat and set sail to Assos, where we were intending to take Paul aboard, for, after giving instructions to this effect, he himself was intending to go on foot.
Acts	44	20	14	So when he caught up with us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene;
Acts	44	20	15	and, sailing away from there the succeeding day, we arrived opposite Chios, but the next day we touched at Samos, and on the following day we arrived at Miletus.
Acts	44	20	16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, in order that he might not spend any time in the district of Asia; for he was hastening to get to Jerusalem on the day of the festival of Pentecost if he possibly could.
Acts	44	20	17	However, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the older men of the congregation.
Acts	44	20	18	When they got to him he said to them: “YOU well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia I was with you the whole time,
Acts	44	20	19	slaving for the Lord with the greatest lowliness of mind and tears and trials that befell me by the plots of the Jews;
Acts	44	20	20	while I did not hold back from telling YOU any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching YOU publicly and from house to house.
Acts	44	20	21	But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
Acts	44	20	22	And now, look! bound in the spirit, I am journeying to Jerusalem, although not knowing the things that will happen to me in it,
Acts	44	20	23	except that from city to city the holy spirit repeatedly bears witness to me as it says that bonds and tribulations are waiting for me.
Acts	44	20	24	Nevertheless, I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.
Acts	44	20	25	“And now, look! I know that all of YOU among whom I went preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.
Acts	44	20	26	Hence I call YOU to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood of all men,
Acts	44	20	27	for I have not held back from telling YOU all the counsel of God.
Acts	44	20	28	Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed YOU overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.
Acts	44	20	29	I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among YOU and will not treat the flock with tenderness,
Acts	44	20	30	and from among YOU yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.
Acts	44	20	31	“Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that for three years, night and day, I did not quit admonishing each one with tears.
Acts	44	20	32	And now I commit YOU to God and to the word of his undeserved kindness, which word can build YOU up and give YOU the inheritance among all the sanctified ones.
Acts	44	20	33	I have coveted no man’s silver or gold or apparel.
Acts	44	20	34	YOU yourselves know that these hands have attended to the needs of me and of those with me.
Acts	44	20	35	I have exhibited to YOU in all things that by thus laboring YOU must assist those who are weak, and must bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’”
Acts	44	20	36	And when he had said these things, he kneeled down with all of them and prayed.
Acts	44	20	37	Indeed, quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all, and they fell upon Paul’s neck and tenderly kissed him,
Acts	44	20	38	because they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they were going to behold his face no more. So they proceeded to conduct him to the boat.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	21	1	Now when we had torn ourselves away from them and put out to sea, we ran with a straight course and came to Cos, but on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
Acts	44	21	2	And when we had found a boat that was crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and sailed away.
Acts	44	21	3	After coming in sight of the island of Cyprus we left it behind on the left side and sailed on to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the boat was to unload its cargo.
Acts	44	21	4	By a search we found the disciples and remained here seven days. But through the spirit they repeatedly told Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts	44	21	5	So when we had completed the days, we went forth and started on our way; but they all, together with the women and children, conducted us as far as outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach we had prayer
Acts	44	21	6	and said good-bye to one another, and we went up into the boat but they returned to their homes.
Acts	44	21	7	We then completed the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed one day with them.
Acts	44	21	8	The next day we set out and arrived in Caesarea, and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelizer, who was one of the seven men, and we stayed with him.
Acts	44	21	9	This man had four daughters, virgins, that prophesied.
Acts	44	21	10	But while we were remaining quite a number of days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea,
Acts	44	21	11	and he came to us and took up the girdle of Paul, bound his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the holy spirit, ‘The man to whom this girdle belongs the Jews will bind in this manner in Jerusalem and deliver into the hands of people of the nations.’”
Acts	44	21	12	Now when we heard this, both we and those of that place began entreating him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts	44	21	13	Then Paul answered: “What are YOU doing by weeping and making me weak at heart? Rest assured, I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
Acts	44	21	14	When he would not be dissuaded, we acquiesced with the words: “Let the will of Jehovah take place.”
Acts	44	21	15	Now after these days we prepared for the journey and began going up to Jerusalem.
Acts	44	21	16	But some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, to bring us to the man at whose home we were to be entertained, a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple.
Acts	44	21	17	When we got into Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
Acts	44	21	18	But on the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the older men were present.
Acts	44	21	19	And he greeted them and began giving in detail an account of the things God did among the nations through his ministry.
Acts	44	21	20	After hearing this they began to glorify God, and they said to him: “You behold, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews; and they are all zealous for the Law.
Acts	44	21	21	But they have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations an apostasy from Moses, telling them neither to circumcise their children nor to walk in the solemn customs.
Acts	44	21	22	What, then, is to be done about it? In any case they are going to hear you have arrived.
Acts	44	21	23	Therefore do this which we tell you: We have four men with a vow upon themselves.
Acts	44	21	24	Take these men along and cleanse yourself ceremonially with them and take care of their expenses, that they may have their heads shaved. And so everybody will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you, but that you are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.
Acts	44	21	25	As for the believers from among the nations, we have sent out, rendering our decision that they should keep themselves from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood and what is strangled and from fornication.”
Acts	44	21	26	Then Paul took the men along the next day and cleansed himself ceremonially with them and went into the temple, to give notice of the days to be fulfilled for the ceremonial cleansing, until the offering should be presented for each one of them.
Acts	44	21	27	Now when the seven days were about to be concluded, the Jews from Asia on beholding him in the temple began to throw all the crowd into confusion, and they laid their hands upon him,
Acts	44	21	28	crying out: “Men of Israel, help! This is the man that teaches everybody everywhere against the people and the Law and this place and, what is more, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”
Acts	44	21	29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, but they were imagining Paul had brought him into the temple.
Acts	44	21	30	And the whole city was set in an uproar, and a running together of the people occurred; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him outside the temple. And immediately the doors were closed.
Acts	44	21	31	And while they were seeking to kill him, information came up to the commander of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion;
Acts	44	21	32	and he at once took soldiers and army officers and ran down to them. When they caught sight of the military commander and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul.
Acts	44	21	33	Then the military commander came near and took hold of him and gave command for him to be bound with two chains; and he proceeded to inquire who he might be and what he had done.
Acts	44	21	34	But some in the crowd began shouting out one thing, and others another. So, being unable himself to learn anything certain because of the tumult, he commanded him to be brought to the soldiers’ quarters.
Acts	44	21	35	But when he got upon the stairs, the situation became such that he was being carried along by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
Acts	44	21	36	for the multitude of the people kept following, crying out: “Take him away!”
Acts	44	21	37	And as he was about to be led into the soldiers’ quarters, Paul said to the military commander: “Am I allowed to say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek?
Acts	44	21	38	Are you not really the Egyptian who before these days stirred up a sedition and led the four thousand dagger men out into the wilderness?”
Acts	44	21	39	Then Paul said: “I am, in fact, a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. So I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.”
Acts	44	21	40	After he gave permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned with his hand to the people. When a great silence fell, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	22	1	“Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to YOU now.”
Acts	44	22	2	(Well, when they heard he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent, and he said:)
Acts	44	22	3	“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral Law, being zealous for God just as all of YOU are this day.
Acts	44	22	4	And I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women,
Acts	44	22	5	as both the high priest and all the assembly of older men can bear me witness. From them I also procured letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring also those who were there bound to Jerusalem to be punished.
Acts	44	22	6	“But as I was journeying and drawing close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me,
Acts	44	22	7	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
Acts	44	22	8	I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’
Acts	44	22	9	Now the men that were with me beheld, indeed, the light but did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.
Acts	44	22	10	At that I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Rise, go your way into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do.’
Acts	44	22	11	But as I could not see anything for the glory of that light, I arrived in Damascus, being led by the hand of those who were with me.
Acts	44	22	12	“Now Ananias, a certain man reverent according to the Law, well reported on by all the Jews dwelling there,
Acts	44	22	13	came to me and, standing by me, he said to me, ‘Saul, brother, have your sight again!’ And I looked up at him that very hour.
Acts	44	22	14	He said, ‘The God of our forefathers has chosen you to come to know his will and to see the righteous One and to hear the voice of his mouth,
Acts	44	22	15	because you are to be a witness for him to all men of things you have seen and heard.
Acts	44	22	16	And now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized and wash your sins away by your calling upon his name.’
Acts	44	22	17	“But when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
Acts	44	22	18	and saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not agree to your witness concerning me.’
Acts	44	22	19	And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves well know that I used to imprison and flog in one synagogue after another those believing upon you;
Acts	44	22	20	and when the blood of Stephen your witness was being spilled, I myself was also standing by and approving and guarding the outer garments of those doing away with him.’
Acts	44	22	21	And yet he said to me, ‘Get on your way, because I shall send you out to nations far off.’”
Acts	44	22	22	Now they kept listening to him down to this word, and they raised their voices, saying: “Take such a man away from the earth, for he was not fit to live!”
Acts	44	22	23	And because they were crying out and throwing their outer garments about and tossing dust into the air,
Acts	44	22	24	the military commander ordered him to be brought into the soldiers’ quarters and said he should be examined under scourging, that he might know fully for what cause they were shouting against him this way.
Acts	44	22	25	But when they had stretched him out for the whipping, Paul said to the army officer standing there: “Is it lawful for YOU men to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?”
Acts	44	22	26	Well, when the army officer heard this, he went to the military commander and made report, saying: “What are you intending to do? Why, this man is a Roman.”
Acts	44	22	27	So the military commander approached and said to him: “Tell me, Are you a Roman?” He said: “Yes.”
Acts	44	22	28	The military commander responded: “I purchased these rights as a citizen for a large sum of money.” Paul said: “But I was even born in them.”
Acts	44	22	29	Immediately, therefore, the men that were about to examine him with torture withdrew from him; and the military commander became afraid on ascertaining that he was a Roman and that he had bound him.
Acts	44	22	30	So, the next day, as he desired to know for sure just why he was being accused by the Jews, he let him loose and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. And he brought Paul down and stood him among them.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	23	1	Looking intently at the Sanhedrin Paul said: “Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with a perfectly clear conscience down to this day.”
Acts	44	23	2	At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.
Acts	44	23	3	Then Paul said to him: “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. Do you at one and the same time sit to judge me in accord with the Law and, transgressing the Law, command me to be struck?”
Acts	44	23	4	Those standing by said: “Are you reviling the high priest of God?”
Acts	44	23	5	And Paul said: “Brothers, I did not know he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.’”
Acts	44	23	6	Now when Paul took note that the one part was of Sadducees but the other of Pharisees, he proceeded to cry out in the Sanhedrin: “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Over the hope of resurrection of the dead I am being judged.”
Acts	44	23	7	Because he said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was split.
Acts	44	23	8	For Sadducees say there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees publicly declare them all.
Acts	44	23	9	So there broke out a loud screaming, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees rose and began contending fiercely, saying: “We find nothing wrong in this man; but if a spirit or an angel spoke to him,—.”
Acts	44	23	10	Now when the dissension grew great, the military commander became afraid that Paul would be pulled to pieces by them, and he commanded the force of soldiers to go down and snatch him from their midst and bring him into the soldiers’ quarters.
Acts	44	23	11	But the following night the Lord stood by him and said: “Be of good courage! For as you have been giving a thorough witness on the things about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.”
Acts	44	23	12	Now when it became day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
Acts	44	23	13	There were more than forty men that formed this oath-bound conspiracy;
Acts	44	23	14	and they went to the chief priests and the older men and said: “We have solemnly bound ourselves with a curse not to take a bite of food until we have killed Paul.
Acts	44	23	15	Now, therefore, YOU together with the Sanhedrin make it clear to the military commander why he should bring him down to YOU as though YOU intended to determine more accurately the matters involving him. But before he gets near we will be ready to do away with him.”
Acts	44	23	16	However, the son of Paul’s sister heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the soldiers’ quarters and reported it to Paul.
Acts	44	23	17	So Paul called one of the army officers to him and said: “Lead this young man off to the military commander, for he has something to report to him.”
Acts	44	23	18	Therefore this man took him and led him to the military commander and said: “The prisoner Paul called me to him and requested me to lead this young man to you, as he has something to tell you.”
Acts	44	23	19	The military commander took him by the hand and withdrew and began inquiring privately: “What is it you have to report to me?”
Acts	44	23	20	He said: “The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow as though intending to learn something more accurate about him.
Acts	44	23	21	Above all things, do not let them persuade you, for more than forty men of theirs are lying in wait for him, and they have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him; and they are now ready, waiting for the promise from you.”
Acts	44	23	22	Therefore the military commander let the young man go after ordering him: “Do not blab to anyone that you have made these things clear to me.”
Acts	44	23	23	And he summoned a certain two of the army officers and said: “Get two hundred soldiers ready to march clear to Caesarea, also seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.
Acts	44	23	24	Also, provide beasts of burden that they may have Paul ride and convey him safely to Felix the governor.”
Acts	44	23	25	And he wrote a letter having this form:
Acts	44	23	26	“Claudius Lysias to his excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings!
Acts	44	23	27	This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be done away with by them, but I came suddenly with a force of soldiers and rescued him, because I learned he was a Roman.
Acts	44	23	28	And wishing to ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin.
Acts	44	23	29	I found him to be accused about questions of their Law, but not charged with a single thing deserving of death or bonds.
Acts	44	23	30	But because a plot that is to be laid against the man has been disclosed to me, I am at once sending him to you, and commanding the accusers to speak against him before you.”
Acts	44	23	31	Therefore these soldiers took Paul according to their orders and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts	44	23	32	The next day they permitted the horsemen to go on with him, and they returned to the soldiers’ quarters.
Acts	44	23	33	The horsemen entered into Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor and also presented Paul to him.
Acts	44	23	34	So he read it and inquired from what province he was, and ascertained that he was from Cilicia.
Acts	44	23	35	“I shall give you a thorough hearing,” he said, “when your accusers arrive also.” And he commanded that he be kept under guard in the praetorian palace of Herod.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	24	1	Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some older men and a public speaker, a certain Tertullus, and they gave information to the governor against Paul.
Acts	44	24	2	When he was called, Tertullus started accusing him, saying: “Seeing that we enjoy great peace through you and that reforms are taking place in this nation through your forethought,
Acts	44	24	3	at all times and also in all places we receive it, Your Excellency Felix, with the greatest thankfulness.
Acts	44	24	4	But that I may not hinder you any further, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your kindliness.
Acts	44	24	5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow and stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth and a spearhead of the sect of the Nazarenes,
Acts	44	24	6	one who also tried to profane the temple and whom we seized.
Acts	44	24	7	——
Acts	44	24	8	From him you yourself can by examination find out about all these things of which we are accusing him.”
Acts	44	24	9	With that the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.
Acts	44	24	10	And Paul, when the governor nodded to him to speak, answered: “Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years, I readily speak in my defense the things about myself,
Acts	44	24	11	as you are in a position to find out that for me it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem;
Acts	44	24	12	and they found me neither in the temple arguing with anyone nor causing a mob to rush together, either in the synagogues or throughout the city.
Acts	44	24	13	Nor can they prove to you the things of which they are accusing me right now.
Acts	44	24	14	But I do admit this to you, that, according to the way that they call a ‘sect,’ in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets;
Acts	44	24	15	and I have hope toward God, which hope these men themselves also entertain, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.
Acts	44	24	16	In this respect, indeed, I am exercising myself continually to have a consciousness of committing no offense against God and men.
Acts	44	24	17	So after quite a number of years I arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation, and offerings.
Acts	44	24	18	While I was at these matters they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple, but not with a crowd or with a tumult. But there were certain Jews from the district of Asia,
Acts	44	24	19	who ought to be present before you and to accuse me if they might have anything against me.
Acts	44	24	20	Or, let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanhedrin,
Acts	44	24	21	except with respect to this one utterance which I cried out while standing among them, ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before YOU!’”
Acts	44	24	22	However, Felix, knowing quite accurately the matters concerning this Way, began to put the men off and said: “Whenever Lysias the military commander comes down, I shall decide upon these matters involving YOU.”
Acts	44	24	23	And he ordered the army officer that the man be kept and have some relaxation of custody, and that he forbid no one of his people to wait upon him.
Acts	44	24	24	Some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and listened to him on the belief in Christ Jesus.
Acts	44	24	25	But as he talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and answered: “For the present go your way, but when I get an opportune time I shall send for you again.”
Acts	44	24	26	At the same time, though, he was hoping for money to be given him by Paul. On that account he sent for him even more frequently and would converse with him.
Acts	44	24	27	But, when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, he left Paul bound.
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	25	1	Therefore Festus, after entering upon the government of the province, went up three days later to Jerusalem from Caesarea;
Acts	44	25	2	and the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews gave him information against Paul. So they began to entreat him,
Acts	44	25	3	asking for themselves as a favor against the man that he would send for him to come to Jerusalem, as they were laying an ambush to do away with him along the road.
Acts	44	25	4	However, Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in Caesarea and that he himself was about to depart shortly for there.
Acts	44	25	5	“Hence let those who are in power among YOU,” he said, “come down with me and accuse him, if there is anything out of the way about the man.”
Acts	44	25	6	So when he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought in.
Acts	44	25	7	When he arrived, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, leveling against him many and serious charges for which they were unable to show evidence.
Acts	44	25	8	But Paul said in defense: “Neither against the Law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I committed any sin.”
Acts	44	25	9	Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, said in reply to Paul: “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?”
Acts	44	25	10	But Paul said: “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also are finding out quite well.
Acts	44	25	11	If, on the one hand, I am really a wrongdoer and have committed anything deserving of death, I do not beg off from dying; if, on the other hand, none of those things exists of which these men accuse me, no man can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to Caesar!”
Acts	44	25	12	Then Festus, after speaking with the assembly of counselors, replied: “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.”
Acts	44	25	13	Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived in Caesarea for a visit of courtesy to Festus.
Acts	44	25	14	So, as they were spending a number of days there, Festus laid before the king the matters respecting Paul, saying: “There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,
Acts	44	25	15	and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the older men of the Jews brought information about him, asking a judgment of condemnation against him.
Acts	44	25	16	But I replied to them that it is not Roman procedure to hand any man over as a favor before the accused man meets his accusers face to face and gets a chance to speak in his defense concerning the complaint.
Acts	44	25	17	Therefore when they got together here, I made no delay, but the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.
Acts	44	25	18	Taking the stand, the accusers produced no charge of the wicked things I had supposed concerning him.
Acts	44	25	19	They simply had certain disputes with him concerning their own worship of the deity and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead but who Paul kept asserting was alive.
Acts	44	25	20	So, being perplexed as to the dispute over these matters, I proceeded to ask if he would like to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.
Acts	44	25	21	But when Paul appealed to be kept for the decision by the August One, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him on up to Caesar.”
Acts	44	25	22	Here Agrippa said to Festus: “I myself would also like to hear the man.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.”
Acts	44	25	23	Therefore, on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much pompous show and entered into the audience chamber together with military commanders as well as men of eminence in the city, and when Festus gave the command, Paul was brought in.
Acts	44	25	24	And Festus said: “King Agrippa and all YOU men who are present with us, YOU are beholding this man concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews together have applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts	44	25	25	But I perceived he had committed nothing deserving of death. So when this man himself appealed to the August One, I decided to send him.
Acts	44	25	26	But concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I brought him forth before YOU, and especially before you, King Agrippa, in order that, after the judicial examination has taken place, I might get something to write.
Acts	44	25	27	For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to signify the charges against him.”
book	book_id	chapter	verse	text
Acts	44	26	1	Agrippa said to Paul: “You are permitted to speak in behalf of yourself.” Then Paul stretched his hand out and proceeded to say in his defense:
Acts	44	26	2	“Concerning all the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I count myself happy that it is before you I am to make my defense this day,
Acts	44	26	3	especially as you are expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
Acts	44	26	4	“Indeed, as to the manner of life from youth up that I led from the beginning among my nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews
Acts	44	26	5	that have been previously acquainted with me from the first know, if they but wish to bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our form of worship I lived a Pharisee.
Acts	44	26	6	And yet now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to our forefathers I stand called to judgment;
Acts	44	26	7	whereas our twelve tribes are hoping to attain to the fulfillment of this promise by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day. Concerning this hope I am accused by Jews, O king.
Acts	44	26	8	“Why is it judged unbelievable among YOU men that God raises up the dead?
Acts	44	26	9	I, for one, really thought within myself I ought to commit many acts of opposition against the name of Jesus the Nazarene;
Acts	44	26	10	which, in fact, I did in Jerusalem, and many of the holy ones I locked up in prisons, as I had received authority from the chief priests; and when they were to be executed, I cast my vote against them.
Acts	44	26	11	And by punishing them many times in all the synagogues I tried to force them to make a recantation; and since I was extremely mad against them, I went so far as to persecuting them even in outside cities.
Acts	44	26	12	“Amid these efforts as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,
Acts	44	26	13	I saw at midday on the road, O king, a light beyond the brilliance of the sun flash from heaven about me and about those journeying with me.
Acts	44	26	14	And when we had all fallen to the ground I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? To keep kicking against the goads makes it hard for you.’
Acts	44	26	15	But I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
Acts	44	26	16	Nevertheless, rise and stand on your feet. For to this end I have made myself visible to you, in order to choose you as an attendant and a witness both of things you have seen and things I shall make you see respecting me;
Acts	44	26	17	while I deliver you from this people and from the nations, to whom I am sending you,
Acts	44	26	18	to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, in order for them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.’
Acts	44	26	19	“Wherefore, King Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly sight,
Acts	44	26	20	but both to those in Damascus first and to those in Jerusalem, and over all the country of Judea, and to the nations I went bringing the message that they should repent and turn to God by doing works that befit repentance.
Acts	44	26	21	On account of these things Jews seized me in the temple and attempted to slay me.
Acts	44	26	22	However, because I have obtained the help that is from God I continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great, but saying nothing except things the Prophets as well as Moses stated were going to take place,
Acts	44	26	23	that the Christ was to suffer and, as the first to be resurrected from the dead, he was going to publish light both to this people and to the nations.”
Acts	44	26	24	Now as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice: “You are going mad, Paul! Great learning is driving you into madness!”
Acts	44	26	25	But Paul said: “I am not going mad, Your Excellency Festus, but I am uttering sayings of truth and of soundness of mind.
Acts	44	26	26	In reality, the king to whom I am speaking with freeness of speech well knows about these things; for I am persuaded that not one of these things escapes his notice, for this thing has not been done in a corner.
Acts	44	26	27	Do you, King Agrippa, believe the Prophets? I know you believe.”
Acts	44	26	28	But Agrippa said to Paul: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.”
Acts	44	26	29	At this Paul said: “I could wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I also am, with the exception of these bonds.”
Acts	44	26	30	And the king rose and so did the governor and Bernice and the men seated with them.
Acts	44	26	31	But as they withdrew they began talking with one another, saying: “This man practices nothing deserving death or bonds.”
Acts	44	26	32	Moreover, Agrippa said to Festus: “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”

Acts	44	27	1	Now as it was decided for us to sail away to Italy, they proceeded to hand both Paul and certain other prisoners over to an army officer named Julius of the band of Augustus.
Acts	44	27	2	Going aboard a boat from Adramyttium that was about to sail to places along the coast of the district of Asia, we set sail, there being with us Aristarchus a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
Acts	44	27	3	And the next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with human kindness and permitted him to go to his friends and enjoy their care.
Acts	44	27	4	And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary;
Acts	44	27	5	and we navigated through the open sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia and put into port at Myra in Lycia.
Acts	44	27	6	But there the army officer found a boat from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy, and he made us board it.
Acts	44	27	7	Then, after sailing on slowly quite a number of days and coming to Cnidus with difficulty, because the wind did not let us get on, we sailed under the shelter of Crete at Salmone,
Acts	44	27	8	and coasting along it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea.
Acts	44	27	9	As considerable time had passed and by now it was hazardous to navigate because even the fast of atonement day had already passed by, Paul made a recommendation,
Acts	44	27	10	saying to them: “Men, I perceive that navigation is going to be with damage and great loss not only of the cargo and the boat but also of our souls.”
Acts	44	27	11	However, the army officer went heeding the pilot and the shipowner rather than the things said by Paul.
Acts	44	27	12	Now as the harbor was inconvenient for wintering, the majority advised setting sail from there, to see if they could somehow make it to Phoenix to winter, a harbor of Crete that opens toward the northeast and toward the southeast.
Acts	44	27	13	Moreover, when the south wind blew softly, they thought they had as good as realized their purpose, and they lifted anchor and began coasting inshore along Crete.
Acts	44	27	14	After no great while, however, a tempestuous wind called Euroaquilo rushed down upon it.
Acts	44	27	15	As the boat was violently seized and was not able to keep its head against the wind, we gave way and were borne along.
Acts	44	27	16	Now we ran under the shelter of a certain small island called Cauda, and yet we were hardly able to get possession of the skiff at the stern.
Acts	44	27	17	But after hoisting it aboard they began using helps to undergird the boat; and being in fear of running aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear and thus were driven along.
Acts	44	27	18	Yet because we were being violently tossed with the tempest, the following day they began to lighten the ship;
Acts	44	27	19	and the third day, with their own hands, they threw away the tackling of the boat.
Acts	44	27	20	When, now, neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no little tempest was lying upon us, all hope of our being saved finally began to be cut off.
Acts	44	27	21	And when there had been a long abstinence from food, then Paul stood up in the midst of them and said: “Men, YOU certainly ought to have taken my advice and not have put out to sea from Crete and have sustained this damage and loss.
Acts	44	27	22	Still, now I recommend to YOU to be of good cheer, for not a soul of YOU will be lost, only the boat will.
Acts	44	27	23	For this night there stood near me an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I render sacred service,
Acts	44	27	24	saying, ‘Have no fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and, look! God has freely given you all those sailing with you.’
Acts	44	27	25	Therefore be of good cheer, men; for I believe God that it will be exactly as it has been told me.
Acts	44	27	26	However, we must be cast ashore on a certain island.”
Acts	44	27	27	Now as the fourteenth night fell and we were being tossed to and fro on the sea of Adria, at midnight the sailors began to suspect they were drawing near to some land.
Acts	44	27	28	And they sounded the depth and found it twenty fathoms; so they proceeded a short distance and again made a sounding and found it fifteen fathoms.
Acts	44	27	29	And because of fearing we might be cast somewhere upon the rocks, they cast out four anchors from the stern and began wishing for it to become day.
Acts	44	27	30	But when the sailors began seeking to escape from the boat and lowered the skiff into the sea under the pretense of intending to let down anchors from the prow,
Acts	44	27	31	Paul said to the army officer and the soldiers: “Unless these men remain in the boat, YOU cannot be saved.”
Acts	44	27	32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.
Acts	44	27	33	Now close to the approach of day Paul began to encourage one and all to take some food, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day YOU have been on the watch and YOU are continuing without food, having taken nothing for yourselves.
Acts	44	27	34	Therefore I encourage YOU to take some food, for this is in the interest of YOUR safety; for not a hair of the head of one of YOU will perish.”
Acts	44	27	35	After he said this, he also took a loaf, gave thanks to God before them all and broke it and started eating.
Acts	44	27	36	So they all became cheerful and themselves began taking some food.
Acts	44	27	37	Now, all together, we souls in the boat were two hundred and seventy-six.
Acts	44	27	38	When they had been satisfied with food, they proceeded to lighten the boat by throwing the wheat overboard into the sea.
Acts	44	27	39	Finally when it became day, they could not recognize the land but they were observing a certain bay with a beach, and on this they were determined, if they could, to beach the boat.
Acts	44	27	40	So, cutting away the anchors, they let them fall into the sea, at the same time loosing the lashings of the rudder oars and, after hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
Acts	44	27	41	When they lighted upon a shoal washed on each side by the sea, they ran the ship aground and the prow got stuck and stayed immovable, but the stern began to be violently broken to pieces.
Acts	44	27	42	At this it became the determination of the soldiers to kill the prisoners, that no one might swim away and escape.
Acts	44	27	43	But the army officer desired to bring Paul safely through and restrained them from their purpose. And he commanded those able to swim to cast themselves into the sea and make it to land first,
Acts	44	27	44	and the rest to do so, some upon planks and some upon certain things from the boat. And thus it came about that all were brought safely to land.

Acts	44	28	1	And when we had made it to safety, then we learned that the island was called Malta.
Acts	44	28	2	And the foreign-speaking people showed us extraordinary human kindness, for they kindled a fire and received all of us helpfully because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.
Acts	44	28	3	But when Paul collected a certain bundle of sticks and laid it upon the fire, a viper came out due to the heat and fastened itself on his hand.
Acts	44	28	4	When the foreign-speaking people caught sight of the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another: “Surely this man is a murderer, and although he made it to safety from the sea, vindictive justice did not permit him to keep on living.”
Acts	44	28	5	However, he shook the venomous creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
Acts	44	28	6	But they were expecting he was going to swell up with inflammation or suddenly drop dead. After they waited for a long while and beheld nothing hurtful happen to him, they changed their mind and began saying he was a god.
Acts	44	28	7	Now in the neighborhood of that place the principal man of the island, named Publius, had lands; and he received us hospitably and entertained us benevolently three days.
Acts	44	28	8	But it happened that the father of Publius was lying down distressed with fever and dysentery, and Paul went in to him and prayed, laid his hands upon him and healed him.
Acts	44	28	9	After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who had sicknesses also began to come to him and be cured.
Acts	44	28	10	And they also honored us with many gifts and, when we were setting sail, they loaded us with things for our needs.
Acts	44	28	11	Three months later we set sail in a boat from Alexandria that had wintered in the island and with the figurehead “Sons of Zeus.”
Acts	44	28	12	And putting into port at Syracuse we remained three days,
Acts	44	28	13	from which place we went around and arrived at Rhegium. And a day later a south wind sprang up and we made it into Puteoli on the second day.
Acts	44	28	14	Here we found brothers and were entreated to remain with them seven days; and in this way we came toward Rome.
Acts	44	28	15	And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to meet us as far as the Marketplace of Appius and Three Taverns and, upon catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.
Acts	44	28	16	When, finally, we entered into Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.
Acts	44	28	17	However, three days later he called together those who were the principal men of the Jews. When they had assembled, he proceeded to say to them: “Men, brothers, although I had done nothing contrary to the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was delivered over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Acts	44	28	18	And these, after making an examination, were desirous of releasing me, as there was no cause for death in me.
Acts	44	28	19	But when the Jews kept speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, but not as though I had anything of which to accuse my nation.
Acts	44	28	20	Really on this account I entreated to see and speak to YOU, for because of the hope of Israel this chain I have around me.”
Acts	44	28	21	They said to him: “Neither have we received letters concerning you from Judea, nor has anyone of the brothers that has arrived reported or spoken anything wicked about you.
Acts	44	28	22	But we think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.”
Acts	44	28	23	They now arranged for a day with him, and they came in greater numbers to him in his lodging place. And he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God and by using persuasion with them concerning Jesus from both the law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.
Acts	44	28	24	And some began to believe the things said; others would not believe.
Acts	44	28	25	So, because they were at disagreement with one another, they began to depart, while Paul made this one comment: “The holy spirit aptly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to YOUR forefathers,
Acts	44	28	26	saying, ‘Go to this people and say: “By hearing, YOU will hear but by no means understand; and, looking, YOU will look but by no means see.
Acts	44	28	27	For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes; that they should never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back, and I should heal them.”’
Acts	44	28	28	Therefore let it be known to YOU that this, the means by which God saves, has been sent out to the nations; they will certainly listen to it.”
Acts	44	28	29	——
Acts	44	28	30	So he remained for an entire two years in his own hired house, and he would kindly receive all those who came in to him,
Acts	44	28	31	preaching the kingdom of God to them and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech, without hindrance.

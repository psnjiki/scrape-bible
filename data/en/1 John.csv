1 John	62	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have viewed attentively and our hands felt, concerning the word of life,
1 John	62	1	2	(yes, the life was made manifest, and we have seen and are bearing witness and reporting to YOU the everlasting life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us,)
1 John	62	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to YOU, that YOU too may be having a sharing with us. Furthermore, this sharing of ours is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
1 John	62	1	4	And so we are writing these things that our joy may be in full measure.
1 John	62	1	5	And this is the message which we have heard from him and are announcing to YOU, that God is light and there is no darkness at all in union with him.
1 John	62	1	6	If we make the statement: “We are having a sharing with him,” and yet we go on walking in the darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth.
1 John	62	1	7	However, if we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light, we do have a sharing with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
1 John	62	1	8	If we make the statement: “We have no sin,” we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us.
1 John	62	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 John	62	1	10	If we make the statement: “We have not sinned,” we are making him a liar, and his word is not in us.

1 John	62	2	1	My little children, I am writing YOU these things that YOU may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.
1 John	62	2	2	And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.
1 John	62	2	3	And by this we have the knowledge that we have come to know him, namely, if we continue observing his commandments.
1 John	62	2	4	He that says: “I have come to know him,” and yet is not observing his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this person.
1 John	62	2	5	But whoever does observe his word, truthfully in this person the love of God has been made perfect. By this we have the knowledge that we are in union with him.
1 John	62	2	6	He that says he remains in union with him is under obligation himself also to go on walking just as that one walked.
1 John	62	2	7	Beloved ones, I am writing YOU, not a new commandment, but an old commandment which YOU have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word which YOU heard.
1 John	62	2	8	Again, I am writing YOU a new commandment, a fact that is true in his case and in YOURS, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
1 John	62	2	9	He that says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness up to right now.
1 John	62	2	10	He that loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in his case.
1 John	62	2	11	But he that hates his brother is in the darkness and is walking in the darkness, and he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1 John	62	2	12	I am writing YOU, little children, because YOUR sins have been forgiven YOU for the sake of his name.
1 John	62	2	13	I am writing YOU, fathers, because YOU have come to know him who is from the beginning. I am writing YOU, young men, because YOU have conquered the wicked one. I write YOU, young children, because YOU have come to know the Father.
1 John	62	2	14	I write YOU, fathers, because YOU have come to know him who is from the beginning. I write YOU, young men, because YOU are strong and the word of God remains in YOU and YOU have conquered the wicked one.
1 John	62	2	15	Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him;
1 John	62	2	16	because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.
1 John	62	2	17	Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.
1 John	62	2	18	Young children, it is the last hour, and, just as YOU have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.
1 John	62	2	19	They went out from us, but they were not of our sort; for if they had been of our sort, they would have remained with us. But they went out that it might be shown up that not all are of our sort.
1 John	62	2	20	And YOU have an anointing from the holy one; all of YOU have knowledge.
1 John	62	2	21	I write YOU, not because YOU do not know the truth, but because YOU know it, and because no lie originates with the truth.
1 John	62	2	22	Who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son.
1 John	62	2	23	Everyone that denies the Son does not have the Father either. He that confesses the Son has the Father also.
1 John	62	2	24	As for YOU, let that which YOU have heard from the beginning remain in YOU. If that which YOU have heard from the beginning remains in YOU, YOU will also abide in union with the Son and in union with the Father.
1 John	62	2	25	Furthermore, this is the promised thing that he himself promised us, the life everlasting.
1 John	62	2	26	These things I write YOU about those who are trying to mislead YOU.
1 John	62	2	27	And as for YOU, the anointing that YOU received from him remains in YOU, and YOU do not need anyone to be teaching YOU; but, as the anointing from him is teaching YOU about all things, and is true and is no lie, and just as it has taught YOU, remain in union with him.
1 John	62	2	28	So now, little children, remain in union with him, that when he is made manifest we may have freeness of speech and not be shamed away from him at his presence.
1 John	62	2	29	If YOU know that he is righteous, YOU gain the knowledge that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him.

1 John	62	3	1	See what sort of love the Father has given us, so that we should be called children of God; and such we are. That is why the world does not have a knowledge of us, because it has not come to know him.
1 John	62	3	2	Beloved ones, now we are children of God, but as yet it has not been made manifest what we shall be. We do know that whenever he is made manifest we shall be like him, because we shall see him just as he is.
1 John	62	3	3	And everyone who has this hope set upon him purifies himself just as that one is pure.
1 John	62	3	4	Everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness, and so sin is lawlessness.
1 John	62	3	5	YOU know too that that one was made manifest to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him.
1 John	62	3	6	Everyone remaining in union with him does not practice sin; no one that practices sin has either seen him or come to know him.
1 John	62	3	7	Little children, let no one mislead YOU; he who carries on righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous.
1 John	62	3	8	He who carries on sin originates with the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil.
1 John	62	3	9	Everyone who has been born from God does not carry on sin, because His reproductive seed remains in such one, and he cannot practice sin, because he has been born from God.
1 John	62	3	10	The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother.
1 John	62	3	11	For this is the message which YOU have heard from the beginning, that we should have love for one another;
1 John	62	3	12	not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother. And for the sake of what did he slaughter him? Because his own works were wicked, but those of his brother were righteous.
1 John	62	3	13	Do not marvel, brothers, that the world hates YOU.
1 John	62	3	14	We know we have passed over from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love remains in death.
1 John	62	3	15	Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer, and YOU know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him.
1 John	62	3	16	By this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his soul for us; and we are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers.
1 John	62	3	17	But whoever has this world’s means for supporting life and beholds his brother having need and yet shuts the door of his tender compassions upon him, in what way does the love of God remain in him?
1 John	62	3	18	Little children, let us love, neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.
1 John	62	3	19	By this we shall know that we originate with the truth, and we shall assure our hearts before him
1 John	62	3	20	as regards whatever our hearts may condemn us in, because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.
1 John	62	3	21	Beloved ones, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have freeness of speech toward God;
1 John	62	3	22	and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we are observing his commandments and are doing the things that are pleasing in his eyes.
1 John	62	3	23	Indeed, this is his commandment, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and be loving one another, just as he gave us commandment.
1 John	62	3	24	Moreover, he who observes his commandments remains in union with him, and he in union with such one; and by this we gain the knowledge that he is remaining in union with us, owing to the spirit which he gave us.

1 John	62	4	1	Beloved ones, do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.
1 John	62	4	2	YOU gain the knowledge of the inspired expression from God by this: Every inspired expression that confesses Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh originates with God,
1 John	62	4	3	but every inspired expression that does not confess Jesus does not originate with God. Furthermore, this is the antichrist’s inspired expression which YOU have heard was coming, and now it is already in the world.
1 John	62	4	4	YOU originate with God, little children, and YOU have conquered those persons, because he that is in union with YOU is greater than he that is in union with the world.
1 John	62	4	5	They originate with the world; that is why they speak what proceeds from the world and the world listens to them.
1 John	62	4	6	We originate with God. He that gains the knowledge of God listens to us; he that does not originate with God does not listen to us. This is how we take note of the inspired expression of truth and the inspired expression of error.
1 John	62	4	7	Beloved ones, let us continue loving one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born from God and gains the knowledge of God.
1 John	62	4	8	He that does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.
1 John	62	4	9	By this the love of God was made manifest in our case, because God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him.
1 John	62	4	10	The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.
1 John	62	4	11	Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us, then we are ourselves under obligation to love one another.
1 John	62	4	12	At no time has anyone beheld God. If we continue loving one another, God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us.
1 John	62	4	13	By this we gain the knowledge that we are remaining in union with him and he in union with us, because he has imparted his spirit to us.
1 John	62	4	14	In addition, we ourselves have beheld and are bearing witness that the Father has sent forth his Son as Savior of the world.
1 John	62	4	15	Whoever makes the confession that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God remains in union with such one and he in union with God.
1 John	62	4	16	And we ourselves have come to know and have believed the love that God has in our case. God is love, and he that remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him.
1 John	62	4	17	This is how love has been made perfect with us, that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment, because, just as that one is, so are we ourselves in this world.
1 John	62	4	18	There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love.
1 John	62	4	19	As for us, we love, because he first loved us.
1 John	62	4	20	If anyone makes the statement: “I love God,” and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.
1 John	62	4	21	And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also.

1 John	62	5	1	Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God, and everyone who loves the one that caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one.
1 John	62	5	2	By this we gain the knowledge that we are loving the children of God, when we are loving God and doing his commandments.
1 John	62	5	3	For this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome,
1 John	62	5	4	because everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.
1 John	62	5	5	Who is the one that conquers the world but he who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John	62	5	6	This is he that came by means of water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the spirit is that which is bearing witness, because the spirit is the truth.
1 John	62	5	7	For there are three witness bearers,
1 John	62	5	8	the spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.
1 John	62	5	9	If we receive the witness men give, the witness God gives is greater, because this is the witness God gives, the fact that he has borne witness concerning his Son.
1 John	62	5	10	The person putting his faith in the Son of God has the witness given in his own case. The person not having faith in God has made him a liar, because he has not put his faith in the witness given, which God as witness has given concerning his Son.
1 John	62	5	11	And this is the witness given, that God gave us everlasting life, and this life is in his Son.
1 John	62	5	12	He that has the Son has this life; he that does not have the Son of God does not have this life.
1 John	62	5	13	I write YOU these things that YOU may know that YOU have life everlasting, YOU who put YOUR faith in the name of the Son of God.
1 John	62	5	14	And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that, no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.
1 John	62	5	15	Further, if we know he hears us respecting whatever we are asking, we know we are to have the things asked since we have asked them of him.
1 John	62	5	16	If anyone catches sight of his brother sinning a sin that does not incur death, he will ask, and he will give life to him, yes, to those not sinning so as to incur death. There is a sin that does incur death. It is concerning that sin that I do not tell him to make request.
1 John	62	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin; and yet there is a sin that does not incur death.
1 John	62	5	18	We know that every person that has been born from God does not practice sin, but the One born from God watches him, and the wicked one does not fasten his hold on him.
1 John	62	5	19	We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.
1 John	62	5	20	But we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us intellectual capacity that we may gain the knowledge of the true one. And we are in union with the true one, by means of his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and life everlasting.
1 John	62	5	21	Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
